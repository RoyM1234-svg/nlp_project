0,"Rochester was glad it was his turn to walk the dog. He generally didn't like to do this chore when company was over, but since Malcolm, the school bully, was one of those visitors he welcomed the chance to get away. Malcolm and his mother, Dr. Von Beddinglam, were over that night to meet Colonel Greenerbaum. Colonel Greenerbaum was a client of Rochester's father. Rochester's mother thought the single Dr. Von Beddinglam and the single Colonel Greenerbaum would want to meet. It turned out to be a bad idea as Colonel Greenerbaum was not nearly as nice as Rochester's parents thought. Rochester's mother reminded Rochester to be very careful while walking the dog, after all Rochester was still in the 6th grade. Rochester assured his mother he would and then zipped up his jacket and grabbed Fido's leash. ""It was nice meeting you Colonel Greenerbaum,"" said Rochester. ""Is it still raining outside?"" grumbled the colonel. ""It was raining cats and dogs early today, made my Cayman S Porsche all muddy."" ""I shall see,"" responded Rochester. There wasn't any rain outside but there was the neighbor's cat on the front porch. After a couple of barks and a loud hiss, the dog began to chase the cat and both pets quickly disappeared into the night. ""Oh dear,"" said Rochester. Rochester's parents moaned. This has happened several times before and every time they would tell Rochester to put the leash on Fido before opening the door. Fortunately, Fido always grew tired of chasing the cat after a few blocks and returned home on his own. ""Well, it looks like it hasn't rained in quite a while, colonel,"" said Rochester. The colonel muttered something inaudibly and then left the house without even thanking Rochester's parents for their hospitality. ""How about some lights?"" growled Colonel Greenerbaum as he walked in the dark towards his Porsche. Before anyone could reply, Colonel Greenerbaum took another step and turned on the motion-sensor light above the garage just as he reached his car. ""Thank you for a lovely evening,"" said Dr. Von Beddinglam. She was always polite and always very gracious. ""Let's go Malcolm!"" Malcolm stumbled into the foyer carrying his electric guitar in his right hand. He didn't have a case for his guitar because the police were holding it as evidence. Rochester hated that guitar. For one, Malcolm used Rochester's face as a pick for a 45-minute rendition of ""Smoke on the Water"" and two: it was a left-handed guitar. ""Thank you for a lovely evening,"" said Malcolm pretending to be sincere. Before Rochester's mother could praise Malcolm for his manners, the colonel yelled: ""someone scratched my car!"" Everyone ran outside and saw that there was a foot long scratch on the driver's side door of Colonel Greenerbaum's brand new Porsche. The scratch ran parallel to the car and was as straight as a ruler. The colonel had backed his car up the driveway, meaning the driver's side was directly next to the driver side of Dr. Von Beddinglams car. The front of her car faced up at the house, while Colonel Greenerbaum's Porsche faced down the steeply sloped driveway towards the street. ""This is your fault,"" shouted Colonel Greenerbaum to Rochester's father. ""I'm going to make you pay! This scratch will cost $759.89 to fix!"" Rochester's father asked Colonel Greenerbaum if maybe the scratch had occurred somewhere else but the colonel insisted the damaged had been done while parked in his driveway. ""I love my Cayman S Porsche and its 295 horsepower. I know what every inch of my car looks like at all times!"" Colonel Greenerbaum grabbed a flashlight from his glove box and used it to give Rochester's father a better look at the scratch. ""Look how long it is,"" exclaimed Colonel Greenerbaum. The colonel licked his thumb and rubbed some mud away from the scratch to reveal that it was two inches longer than previously estimated. ""What do you think?"" asked Rochester's mother. ""It looks like a new scratch but I don't know. How can we be sure it happened here?"" wondered Rochester's father. Just then, Fido returned home with his tongue hanging out of his mouth. Rochester quickly attached the leashed to his collar and gave him a little scratch behind the ears. ""Your dog is suspect number one. Look at his collar. It's the same height as the scratch. He could have done it when he chased the cat. I told you it's your fault."" Rochester's father agreed that Fido could have scratched the Porsche but he still wasn't convinced. ""You're daughter Roxie rode her bike home. Her bike could have done it and that makes her suspect number two."" Roxie had returned from the library shortly after Colonel Greenerbaum arrived. Dinner was delayed while everyone waited for her to change her clothes. During Roxie's ride home, her bicycle's back tire splashed mud all over her. ""She coasted her bike between the two cars and scratched the car with her pedal."" Colonel Greenerbaum grabbed Roxie's bike; it was leaning up against the garage door. The colonel positioned the bike so it faced in the same direction Roxie would have been travelling when she came up the driveway. He then positioned the pedal on Roxie's bike at the same height as the scratch on his Porsche. Next the colonel moved the bike forward, but didn't move the pedal, to show how Roxie's bike could have scratched his Porsche while coasting home. ""It's possible,"" admitted Rochester's father. ""I'll go and ask my daughter if she scratched your car."" Rochester's mother buried her head in her hand. Her daughter would never purposely damage someone's property, but she is so easily distracted that she could have very well scratched the Porsche without even realizing it. ""Why? She'll just lie or you'll lie to protect her. Besides, if it wasn't her then it was the boy and his guitar."" The colonel claimed to have seen the guitar when he got out of his Porsche and Malcolm's mother admitted it was kept in the back seat on the driver's side. All agreed that the scratch on the Porsche could have been caused by some of the metal parts on Malcolm's guitar. ""Dr. Von Beddinglam told us before dinner that Malcolm was caught once vandalizing a car. He's a juvenile delinquent. I know he scratched my Porsche with his guitar and since it happened on your property you'll have to pay,"" said the colonel. ""But when did Malcolm scratch your car?"" asked Rochester's father. ""When you were in the kitchen doing the dishes. His mother gave him the keys to her vehicle so he could go and fetch his guitar. Here's how he did it.""
The colonel ripped the guitar out of Malcolm's right hand and then demonstrated how he scratched the car while walking back to the house. According to the colonel, Malcolm would have walked back to the house with the Porsche on his left side while holding the neck of the guitar in his left hand. Rochester's father admitted it was very plausible especially the way the cars were parked. Dr. Von Beddinglam asked her son if he had scratched the car and of course he said he didn't. ""It doesn't matter what he says. The kid is a hoodlum,"" proclaimed Colonel Greenerbaum. I gave you three suspects."" ""You forgot to include yourself,"" remarked Rochester. The colonel glared at Rochester. ""Colonel, one of the suspects can't speak. The other probably doesn't even remember and the third is a known lair. How are we supposed to know what really happened?"" asked Rochester's father. ""I told you there are only three possible ways it could have happened."" ""You forgot to include the possibility that the car was already scratched,"" remarked Rochester. Again the colonel glared at Rochester. ""Regardless of what your son thinks, or which of the three ways it happened, you are responsible. I demand you pay to have the scratch fixed or I'll take my business elsewhere."" Colonel Greenerbaum was Rochester's father’s top client. If he lost the colonel's business he could possibly lose his entire business. ""I'm sorry about your car, Colonel. I will pay to have it fixed."" Rochester's father was dejected but he saw no other around the mystery of the scratched Porsche and no other way to keep the colonel's business. Suddenly, the motion sensor light turned itself off after its long programmable delay period had expired. In another coincidence, the neighbor's cat returned. Fido saw the feline and tried to chase it but all he did was jerked the leash taunt and turn the motion sensor light back on. ""Father,"" said Rochester, ""I know who is responsible for the scratch on the colonel's Porsche.""","[‘Colonel Greenerbaum’, ‘Fido’,  ‘Malcolm’, ‘Roxie’]","To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **Colonel Greenerbaum's alibi:** The colonel claimed that Malcolm scratched his car when he was in the kitchen doing the dishes. However, the colonel demonstrated the scratch by walking back to the house with the Porsche on his left side while holding the neck of the guitar in his left hand. This is a contradiction because if the colonel was in the kitchen, he couldn't have been walking back to the house with the Porsche on his left side. Therefore, the colonel's alibi is suspicious.

2. **Roxie's bike:** The colonel suggested that Roxie's bike could have caused the scratch. However, the scratch on the Porsche is parallel to the car and as straight as a ruler, which is unlikely to be caused by a bike with a splattered mud back tire. This makes Roxie's involvement less likely.

3. **Fido's leash:** The colonel pointed out that Fido's leash is the same height as the scratch. However, Fido is a dog, and his leash is attached to his collar, which is unlikely to cause a scratch as straight and long as the one on the Porsche.

4. **Malcolm's guitar:** The colonel demonstrated that Malcolm's guitar could have caused the scratch. However, Malcolm was carrying the guitar in his right hand when he came back to the house, not in his left hand, which contradicts the colonel's demonstration.

5. **The motion sensor light:** The motion sensor light turned itself off after its programmable delay period expired, and Fido's attempt to chase the cat turned it back on. This suggests that the light was not used by anyone, including the colonel, to inspect the scratch.

6. **Colonel Greenerbaum's behavior:** The colonel was grumpy and demanding throughout the evening, which suggests that he might be trying to manipulate the situation to his advantage.

Considering these points, the most suspicious person is **Colonel Greenerbaum**. His alibi is suspicious, and his behavior throughout the evening is aggressive and manipulative. The other suspects, Roxie and Malcolm, have some flaws in their alibis, but they don't seem as deliberate and manipulative as the colonel. Fido, being a dog, is unlikely to cause a scratch as straight and long as the one on the Porsche. 

GUILTY: Colonel Greenerbaum
"
1,"Reverend Dan Parsons had to admit to some human pride whenever he thought of the church he had built. Now in its sixth year, what had started as a handful of people in his living room had grown into a membership of over 600 faithful. What impressed and pleased him the most, as he sat sipping a cup of coffee in his modest office one afternoon shortly after Thanksgiving, was that the membership was an excellent mixture of the young and old. There were many young couples with children of all ages but also a solid group of senior citizens to go along with the many middle-aged persons in his congregation. His attention now turned to Christmas and the decorating of the church. The “Hanging of the Greens” in the sanctuary was one of the best times of the year for Pastor Dan, for it commenced the Season of Advent. It was his favorite time in the Christian year. A tradition, which he had started in the young church’s first year, was the Christmas tree in the sanctuary. This year, the new sanctuary had been completed and there would be ample room for a large tree and the gifts to God, which the membership would place beneath it. These gifts would be distributed to the various local charitable organizations shortly before Christmas Day. Pastor Dan was very pleased that this had quickly become a tradition at the young church. The people in his flock were kind, generous and not forgetful of the disadvantaged persons living in the community. All of this was running through his mind as he walked to the sanctuary to examine the tree, which had been placed a week ago. What he found underneath it surprised him, for not only did he find the first few gifts to the hungry and homeless people, but also there were several brightly colored gift-wrapped boxes addressed to various children of the church. They were simply marked as being, “From Santa.” Pastor Dan did not think anything of this at first, but the next day he noticed several more gifts. They were similarly wrapped and again addressed to individual children of the church “From Santa.” Bright sunlight coming through the new sanctuary window bathed the beautifully decorated tree. At this moment, Pastor Dan realized that the tree was blessed by God and a Secret Santa Claus was leaving gifts for the church children beneath it. He smiled and wondered who in his congregation was performing good works in secret. Back in his office, with afternoon coffee firmly in hand, Pastor Dan paused to reflect. Security was tight in the new church and besides staff members there were only a handful of persons with keys to the main building, which housed the sanctuary. After finishing his coffee, Dan could only think of five parishioners who could be Secret Santa. Three of them chaired key committees and the other two were members of the building committee. They just happened to be all men, men of all ages. Pastor Dan realized that “Santa Claus” could very easily be a staff member and/or a female. But, his years as an ordained minister had placed within him a keen intuition and sixth sense regarding church business and spiritual matters. He had a hunch that “Santa” was one of the five non-staff church members with keys to the main building. Dan thought no more about this for the remainder of the day, for his afternoon and evening were busy with committee meetings plus the death of one of the elder church member’s sister. Around 10:00 p.m., Dan sat in his office, which was only a few feet down the hall from the entrance to the sanctuary and quietly sipped a diet drink. He was grateful the long day was over. He knew he would have another one tomorrow. The door his office was closed and his light was off. He loved the feeling of peace and spirituality the quiet office offered under such circumstances. As he sat in silence, alone with his thoughts, he heard noises in the sanctuary. Immediately he suspected that Santa Claus was making a delivery. He was alone in the darkened, closed pastor’s office, and his car was parked around in back. Santa no doubt came in the front entrance, believing the building was empty. Acting quickly, Dan silently crept to the sanctuary door, peeking in to see what was happening. What he saw startled him in a way he had never experienced before -- and in his time in ministry he had seen much. He saw a man dressed as Santa placing gifts underneath the big tree. The man moved quickly and, when he arose, Dan noticed he was not pudgy like the real Santa Claus at all, but rather he was slender and very graceful. He had to move very quickly and as silently as Santa did to make it back to his office before being seen. Dan’s curiosity now got the better of him. He knew he would not rest until he got to the bottom of this. He planned to be secretly in the building every night for the remainder of the week. He hoped Santa had not finished his work. Dan strongly suspected he had not. The next night, Pastor Dan took extra precautions, returning to the church around 9:30 p.m. and leaving his automobile parked around the block. A little after 10:00, he was rewarded for his diligence. This time, he heard “Santa” quietly enter the main building at the front door. He did not leave his office until he was certain Santa was in the sanctuary. He got to the door in time to see Santa hurry toward the tree carrying a huge sack. It was obviously heavy as Dan noticed Santa used both hands to tote it. Santa again laid the gifts underneath the tree quickly. This time, Dan knew Santa would hurry out of the sanctuary to exit the building so he returned to his office as Santa placed the last gift at the foot of the tree. Dan spent most of the next day thinking of Secret Santa. Who could it be? Dan did not know it yet but he would get his answer later that night. The scenario was the same as it had been the previous two nights. Dan observed Santa quickly and silently entering the church building to place Christmas gifts underneath the tree for the children of the church. As Dan, for the third night in a row, spied on Santa from outside the sanctuary, he recalled with amusement receiving the first telephone call about the gifts underneath the tree from a curious parishioner late that morning. He told the caller that there was a Secret Santa Claus in the congregation but had no idea who he really was. Dan noticed that Santa reached into the sack of gifts with his left hand. Quickly and efficiently, as in the two nights previously, he was very graceful in his movements and wasted no time or effort. Dan thought to himself that this was no doubt how the real Santa Claus worked. How could it be otherwise if he wanted to visit all the homes of small children the world over in one night? Dan quietly trekked the few feet back to his office. Sitting silently as Santa quickly locked the front door and drove away, he thought seriously about the identity of his congregations’ Santa Claus. Very soon, more parishioners would be asking questions about Santa Claus and the presents underneath the tree. Pastor Dan thought of the five men who possessed keys to the main building. First on his mind was Al Busby. Al chaired the Church Council and was the oldest of the group at 77. He was a wonderful man but suffered from arthritic knees and walked with a cane. Next, he considered Chuck Daughtry. Chuck was the youngest of the men at age 33 and a member of the building committee. He was also a member of the church’s newly formed basketball team and the first to suffer injury in a game, badly breaking an arm a couple of weeks ago. Dan’s thoughts turned to Jim Dockery. Jim was 45 years old and a former professional baseball player. Jim was the Pastor-Parish Relations committee chair and, as such, Dan knew him well. He recalled fondly the last time they had dined together, discussing church business and swapping stories. He learned that Jim used to pitch for a Triple-A minor league team and was the first left-handed pitcher on that team to throw a no-hitter. He was very proud of that and Dan was a man who had much to be proud of, for Dan had grown wealthy with the computer company he had founded 15 years ago. Pastor Dan was deep in thought. But, he laughed out loud as he considered Bob Key as Santa Claus. Bobby, as he was called, was 65 years old and one of the most lovable men in the church. If anyone could be Santa Claus, it would be Bobby. However, Dan’s amusement turned to somberness as he recalled Bobby’s clumsiness. Last year, he broke a leg falling down stairs and, just recently, broke a lamp in Dan’s office during a meeting of the building committee. Finally, he thought of Jeff Reynolds. Jeff’s story was a sad one. Jeff was 41 years old but had suffered a minor stroke last year. He had lost his job stacking freight in a warehouse because he walked with a limp and had lost strength on his right side. But, his fate could have been far worse. He was the best committee worker of the five and had lost none of his organizational and administrative skills. Jeff and his family considered him very fortunate. Could a grateful Jeff Reynolds be “Secret Santa?” Sipping a cold diet cola, Dan sat in thoughtful silence until almost midnight. Then it came to him and he wondered why it took him so long to figure it out. Before locking up, a very relieved Pastor Dan called his wife to tell her he was coming home. Before hanging up, he said, “and I know who our Secret Santa is.”","[‘Al Busby’, 'Bob (Bobby) Key’, ‘Chuck Daughtry’, ‘Jeff Reynolds’, ‘Jim Dockery’]","Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who the Secret Santa is.

1.  Pastor Dan observed that the gifts were being placed quickly and silently, suggesting that the person is agile and has no mobility issues.
2.  The gifts were placed in the sanctuary, which is a large room that requires some effort to carry gifts, suggesting that the person is physically capable of lifting and carrying heavy loads.
3.  The person uses their left hand to reach into the sack of gifts, which is an interesting detail.
4.  Pastor Dan eliminated Al Busby as a suspect because he suffers from arthritic knees and walks with a cane, which would make it difficult for him to move quickly and silently.
5.  Pastor Dan also considered Chuck Daughtry, but he had broken his arm a couple of weeks ago and may still be recovering from the injury, which would limit his ability to carry heavy loads or move quickly.
6.  Bob Key, or Bobby, is described as being lovable and clumsy, and he has broken a leg and a lamp recently, which suggests that he may not be the most agile person.
7.  Jim Dockery, on the other hand, is described as a former professional baseball player who was the first left-handed pitcher to throw a no-hitter in his minor league team. This suggests that he has a strong and agile left arm, which would be useful for reaching into a sack of gifts with his left hand.
8.  Finally, Pastor Dan considered Jeff Reynolds, but he has a limp and lost strength on his right side due to a minor stroke, which would make it difficult for him to carry heavy loads or move quickly.

Considering all these details, the evidence points to Jim Dockery as the most likely suspect. He has the physical ability to carry heavy loads, move quickly and silently, and use his left hand to reach into the sack of gifts. The fact that he is a former professional baseball player also suggests that he has the physical dexterity and coordination to perform the tasks required of Secret Santa.

GUILTY: Jim Dockery"
