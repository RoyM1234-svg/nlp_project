"Let's break down the evidence step by step to determine who caused the accident.

1. **Timeline**: The accident happened around 9:35 a.m. Larry claimed to have arrived at the Water Works at 8:30 a.m. and had a parking ticket on his dash. This means Larry was at the location around 9:20-9:30 a.m. to get his ticket, which places him in the vicinity of the accident.

2. **Vehicles involved**: The police described the car that swerved to avoid the suspect vehicle as having the right of way. This implies that the suspect vehicle ran the red light. However, Nathan's vans are the only ones mentioned to be in the area, but Larry had a parking ticket on his dash, which might imply he wasn't the one driving the vehicle involved in the accident.

3. **Alibis**: Chris and Larry both claimed to have been at the Water Works at the time of the accident. However, Nathan had a suspicious reaction to the question of who caused the accident, implying he might be hiding something.

4. **Nathan's motives**: Nathan seemed particularly invested in finding out who caused the accident, which suggests he might be trying to deflect attention from himself. However, his initial reaction to the accusation was to point at his employees, which could be a smokescreen.

5. **Dave's involvement**: Dave's alibi for the time of the accident is shaky, as he was at the Java Hut, which was closed when Chris passed by. However, this doesn't necessarily place him at the scene of the accident.

Considering all the evidence, I believe Chris Henderson is the most likely culprit. Here's why:

* Chris claimed to have beaten Larry in squash, which could imply he was at the Water Works at the time of the accident.
* Chris didn't provide a concrete alibi for the time of the accident, unlike Larry.
* Nathan's reaction to the accusation suggests he might be trying to deflect attention from himself, but Chris's lack of alibi makes him a more likely suspect.
* Chris's statement about beating Larry with un-caffeinated skill could be a red herring, as it's unlikely he would admit to driving recklessly without mentioning it.

"To analyze the evidence and solve the mystery, let's break it down step by step:

1.  **Initial Clues:**
    - The scarecrow's heart, a big and shiny prop, goes missing.
    - Mrs. Tillman, the teacher, is very attached to this prop and is devastated by its loss.
    - The other props were easily accounted for and put away.
    - The only person who could have been alone with the heart was the person who was tasked with storing the props.

2.  **Eric's Suspicious Behavior:**
    - Eric was wearing a long-sleeved shirt on a warm day, which could be a sign that he was trying to hide a rash or an allergic reaction from touching the straw.
    - However, Eric was not the only one who could have had access to the straw, as he was just one of the people cleaning up after the play.
    - Eric's behavior doesn't necessarily implicate him in the theft, but it's an interesting observation.

3.  **Wendy's Reaction:**
    - When confronted about the possibility of stealing the heart, Wendy became defensive and accusatory, asking if the detective thought she stole it.
    - This reaction suggests that she might be hiding something or trying to deflect suspicion from herself.

4.  **The Twins' Alibis:**
    - Jimmy and Jenny both claimed to have seen the heart about 15 minutes before they left the school. This is a crucial piece of information because it places them in a different location at the time the heart went missing.
    - If the twins were indeed the last people to see the heart, it's unlikely that they could have taken it without anyone noticing.

5.  **Final Observation:**
    - The detective has five minutes left in lunch period to figure out who stole the heart.
    - Given the information gathered, the detective has enough evidence to point to the thief.

Considering all the evidence, the detective should investigate further, but based on the provided clues, it seems that **Wendy LaRue** is the most likely suspect. Her defensive reaction when confronted about the theft and the fact that the twins were the last ones to see the heart, which doesn't necessarily implicate them, point towards Wendy as the culprit.

"To determine the guilty person, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The display case was cleaned by Randy Newsom and Shorty Gilstrap, with Mary Thornton helping to clean the glass windows. This means that all three suspects had access to the display case, but we need to look for the person who actually stole the second base.
2.  Randy Newsom claims that he put everything back in the display case, including the second base, after Mary helped him clean it. However, when questioned, he seems somewhat evasive and gets sidetracked by talking about Mary's appearance. This might indicate that he's hiding something.
3.  Shorty Gilstrap confirms that the second base was present when he left to help bring in tables, and he returned the keys to Coach Morgan. However, Shorty's nickname ""Pigpen"" suggests that he might be careless and prone to making a mess, which could be a red flag.
4.  Mary Thornton claims that everything was still in the display case when she left, and she only returned to adjust a trophy. However, she's the one who had the opportunity to take the second base and put it back in the case without anyone noticing. She also had a motive to steal the second base, as she's described as being proud and possibly a bit vain.
5.  Coach Morgan is the only person who doesn't seem to have a clear alibi for the time the second base went missing. He's the one who gave the keys to Randy and later to Shorty, but he's not present during the time of the theft. This suggests that he might have orchestrated the theft to make it look like one of the other suspects was responsible.
6.  However, Coach Morgan's alibi is not as suspicious as the fact that he seems to be deflecting attention from himself and making jokes about the lack of attention from the school newspaper. This behavior is consistent with a person who's trying to hide something.

Based on the analysis, I think the most likely culprit is Coach Joe Morgan. He had the opportunity to give the keys to Randy and Shorty, and he seems to be trying to deflect attention from himself. His behavior and lack of alibi make him the most suspicious person in the case.",Unknown,Mary Thornton,2
"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. The murder occurred on a spring evening around 10:00 p.m.
2. The victim, Earl, was found slumped over in a chair with a knife mark in his neck.
3. The killer, Edward, had a violent temper and was involved in a taboo situation (getting a young woman pregnant out of wedlock).
4. The argument between Earl and Edward was so severe that Earl lost his life.
5. Anita was terrified and locked herself in her room when the argument began.
6. Mildrid was downstairs and close to the stairs, but not directly in the area where the murder occurred.
7. The upstairs bath had a chair and reading table, and was a rare feature at the time.
8. The murder was a violent stabbing that would have generated a lot of blood.
9. The rooms that had carpeting were Edward's and Anita's, but the master bedroom had no carpeting and no throw rugs.

Given these points, let's consider the possibilities:

- The bathroom is unlikely, as there is no evidence to suggest that the murder occurred in this room.
- Anita's room is a possibility, but she was locked in her room during the argument, which suggests she was not directly involved in the murder.
- Harry's room is unlikely, as he was estranged from the family at the time of the murder.
- The master bedroom is a strong possibility, as it had no carpeting and no throw rugs, which would have made it easier to clean up a large amount of blood.

However, the key to solving the mystery lies in the fact that the murder was covered up, and the letter was hidden behind the wallpaper in the formal dining room. This suggests that the killer may have taken steps to conceal evidence of the crime, but not necessarily to clean up the blood.

Considering the lack of carpeting in the master bedroom, it is likely that the killer chose this room to commit the crime because it was easier to clean up the blood. The fact that the murder was covered up suggests that the killer was trying to conceal evidence of the crime, but not necessarily to remove any physical evidence.

Therefore, based on the evidence, I believe that the murder occurred in the master bedroom of Earl and Mildrid Jensen.

"Let's analyze the evidence carefully.

1.  Greg's behavior: Greg had been practicing chess for a long time and had become quite skilled. He had even boasted about beating Uncle Larry in the past, which suggests that he was eager to win this time. However, when the chess pieces went missing, he was furious and seemed to be disappointed that he hadn't found them himself. This behavior doesn't necessarily imply guilt, but it's worth noting.

2.  Greg's physical abilities: Greg didn't have a back injury like his father, which means he wouldn't have had to worry about lifting heavy objects.

3.  The note: The note left behind was written in neat letters, suggesting that the person who wrote it was careful and deliberate. However, the note itself was taunting, which might suggest that the writer was someone who was close to the family, possibly a family member.

4.  The placement of the chess pieces: The pieces were found in a bag tied to a tree branch, which suggests that the person who hid them wanted to create a challenge for the family to find them. This could imply that the person was someone who wanted to test their loved ones' problem-solving skills.

5.  The behavior of the family members after the pieces were found: Greg seemed disappointed that he hadn't found the pieces himself, while Tina was proud of herself for discovering them. The father and mother seemed concerned about the fact that someone in the family had hidden the pieces, which suggests that they might be considering the possibility that one of their own children was involved.

6.  The father's behavior: The father had a back injury that prevented him from lifting heavy objects, but he carried a big stack of logs into the cabin, which suggests that he might be capable of lifting heavy objects when he wants to. However, he also seemed proud of Tina for finding the pieces, which could suggest that he wasn't involved in hiding them.

7.  The mother's suggestion: The mother suggested that the game might not be played after all, which could suggest that she was trying to prevent the game from being played, possibly because she wanted to protect one of her children.

8.  My dramatic announcement: I decided to reveal who stole the chess pieces, but the story doesn't reveal who I accused.

After analyzing the evidence, I noticed that the father had a back injury that prevented him from lifting heavy objects, but he carried a big stack of logs into the cabin. This suggests that he might be capable of lifting heavy objects when he wants to. Furthermore, the father seemed proud of Tina for finding the pieces, which could suggest that he wasn't involved in hiding them.

However, the mother's suggestion to not play the game after all, combined with the fact that the father seemed to be considering the possibility that one of their own children was involved, made me think of a different scenario.

I realized that the father's behavior was suspicious because he had a back injury that prevented him from lifting heavy objects, but he carried a big stack of logs into the cabin. This is a contradiction, and it made me think that the father might have had help carrying the logs. If the father had help carrying the logs, it's possible that he had help hiding the chess pieces as well.

Furthermore, the mother's suggestion to not play the game after all, combined with the fact that the father seemed to be considering the possibility that one of their own children was involved, made me think that the father might be trying to protect one of his children.

Given the evidence, I think the father was trying to protect his son Greg, who was eager to beat Uncle Larry in the game. The father didn't want Greg to lose to Uncle Larry, so he hid the chess pieces to prevent the game from being played.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and follow the events described by Sam Jaspers.

**Step 1: Analyze the discovery of the handbag**

Sam discovers a handbag containing a large amount of money and family pictures in the ladies' restroom. The handbag belongs to an old lady who had visited the diner earlier, but couldn't have used the restroom because of the steps. Sam remembers seeing the handbag hanging on the back of her booth, but didn't think much of it at the time.

**Step 2: Analyze the events leading up to the discovery**

After the old lady left, the diner was empty except for Mary Ingram and Sarah Upton. John Beddington came in to visit Sam, but left after a short time. Tom Greene left early, and Louisa Perry was the only waitress on duty.

**Step 3: Analyze the behavior of the suspects**

*   Mary Ingram: She went to the ladies' room after leaving her table, but Sam had already taken the ""No Admission"" sign off the door. She came out a few minutes later with fresh makeup, which suggests that she may have been trying to conceal something.
*   Sarah Upton: She seemed reluctant to leave the diner and tried to prolong her stay.
*   John Beddington: He left the diner after a short time and didn't seem to be involved in the events leading up to the discovery of the handbag.
*   Louisa Perry: She was the only one who had access to the ladies' room after the old lady left, and her behavior was described as ""foul"" after Sarah Upton left.

**Step 4: Analyze the clues**

The key clue is that the handbag was found in the ladies' restroom, and the only person who could have moved it from the back of Mary's booth to the restroom was Louisa Perry. The fact that Louisa was in a foul mood after Sarah Upton left suggests that she may have been trying to conceal her guilt.

**Conclusion**

Based on the analysis of the evidence and the events described, the most likely culprit is Louisa Perry. She had access to the ladies' restroom, and her behavior suggests that she may have been trying to conceal her guilt. The fact that she was in a foul mood after Sarah Upton left also suggests that she may have been trying to intimidate her, possibly to prevent her from revealing what she knew.

1.  Paula put the cupcake in a paper bag and placed it on the top shelf. This is a crucial piece of evidence because it shows that the cupcake was in a secure location, and it would require someone to retrieve it in order to eat it.

2.  When Paula returns to the office kitchen at noon, the cupcake is missing. This suggests that someone must have retrieved the cupcake from the top shelf.

3.  Mr. Bento is initially present in the kitchen when Paula discovers the missing cupcake, but he claims he didn't take it. While this could be a possible alibi, it's not entirely convincing given his round belly and his previous comment about the cupcake being high in calories.

4.  Julianna claims she didn't take the cupcake because she was too busy working. However, this could be a plausible alibi, but it's also possible that she was trying to deflect suspicion.

5.  Geraldine suggests that she didn't take the cupcake because she forgot her teeth and couldn't eat it. However, this could be a clever distraction, and she might be trying to throw Paula off her trail.

6.  The most important piece of evidence comes when Geraldine leads Paula and Julianna to Luis's cubicle and shows them the paper bag containing the cupcake in the wastebasket. This suggests that Luis must have retrieved the cupcake from the top shelf.

7.  Luis claims he didn't take the cupcake because he was out running errands all morning. However, this could be a lie, and it's possible that he was trying to create an alibi.

8.  Now, let's consider the behavior of each suspect:

    *   Mr. Bento seemed suspicious, but his alibi is shaky at best. However, he didn't have a clear motive to steal the cupcake.
    *   Julianna seemed busy, but she might have been trying to deflect suspicion. She didn't have a clear motive to steal the cupcake either.
    *   Geraldine seemed clever and observant, but she might have been trying to throw Paula off her trail. However, she didn't have a clear motive to steal the cupcake.
    *   Luis had a clear motive to steal the cupcake, as it was a gift he gave to Paula. His alibi is also shaky, as he claims he was out running errands all morning, but we don't know for sure if he was actually there or not.

9.  Considering all the evidence, Luis seems to be the most likely culprit. He had a clear motive to steal the cupcake, and his alibi is shaky at best. The fact that the cupcake was found in his wastebasket further supports this conclusion.

"To solve this mystery, I'll analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The story starts with Grandpa telling his grandchildren about the treasure of Dead Man's Island. He mentions that his grandfather shared a secret with him when he was 5 years old, but he didn't reveal the secret until Grandpa was 80 years old. This suggests that Grandpa is telling the truth about his grandfather sharing the secret with him.

2.  When the grandchildren ask why Grandpa didn't search for the treasure himself, he says he thought his grandfather might have made it up. However, he also mentions that he believed the island had disappeared in 1928. This indicates that Grandpa might be trying to hide something.

3.  When they find the article about Dead Man's Island in the book, it confirms the existence of the island and its location. However, Mike claims that the island was dredged in 1928 to make it easier for ships to enter the port. This seems suspicious, as it could be a cover-up for something.

4.  When they arrive at the location where the treasure is supposed to be, Mike goes to scope out the geography, and they find that someone has already dug a hole. This raises suspicions, but Grandpa seems to think it's not deep enough.

5.  As they continue digging, they find the pouch with the ""S.S. Charleston"" branding and layers of brittle material. However, there's no indication that they found any actual treasure.

6.  The final clue is Bobby's statement that he knows who's been lying. Considering the evidence, I'll analyze each suspect's behavior and motives.

- Grandpa: He seems to be telling the truth about his grandfather sharing the secret with him. However, he might be hiding something, as he didn't search for the treasure himself. But, his behavior doesn't seem suspicious enough to be the culprit.
- Grandpa's grandfather: He's not a suspect, as he's deceased.
- Lisa: She seems eager to help the grandchildren find the island, but she's not present when the digging happens. Her behavior doesn't seem suspicious enough to be the culprit.
- Mike: He's the one who claims the island was dredged in 1928, which seems like a cover-up. He also goes to scope out the geography before the others, which could be an opportunity to dig the hole themselves. His behavior seems suspicious, and he's the one who's most likely to have been digging the hole before the others arrived.

Considering the evidence, the most likely culprit is Mike. He has a motive to hide the treasure and has the opportunity to dig the hole before the others arrive. His behavior seems suspicious, and he's the only one who could have been lying about the island being dredged in 1928.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The theft occurred on Sunday, and the alarm was deactivated at 11:03 a.m. and reactivated three minutes later. This indicates that the thief had access to the codes and knew the timing of the alarm system.
2.  A trail of sand was found from the thief's pants or shoes, which didn't match the local sand in Arizona. This suggests that the thief came from somewhere else.
3.  The four students had just returned from a three-day weekend, and it's likely that the thief got sandy while on vacation.
4.  Denise broke her leg in Aspen, Colorado, and her parents drove her back to Arizona on Sunday afternoon. However, this would have left her with a cast, which would have made it difficult for her to get sandy.
5.  Jim visited the International UFO Museum and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico, over the weekend. However, the sand found didn't match the sand in New Mexico, so it's unlikely that Jim is the thief.
6.  Juan spent his weekend in Long Beach, California, surfing. However, the sand found didn't match the sand in California, so it's unlikely that Juan is the thief.
7.  Skye went scuba diving in Cozumel, Mexico, and her plane was delayed, returning to Arizona on Monday morning. However, the sand found didn't match the sand in Mexico, so it's unlikely that Skye is the thief.

Considering the evidence, we can conclude that the thief must have come from a place with sand that matches the sand found at the crime scene. None of the students' alibis match this criterion. However, there is a crucial detail that might have been overlooked: Denise's parents drove her back to Arizona on Sunday afternoon, but she said they contacted her after she was patched up at the hospital. This implies that she was in a hospital, which would have been a sterile environment, unlikely to have sand. However, when asked about how she managed to get home with her broken leg, Denise mentioned that her parents contacted her after she was patched up, but she didn't mention being in a hospital in a specific location. She said they came and drove her home, but we don't know if they drove her home directly or stopped at some other location first.

However, when looking closer at the evidence, we see that the thief must have been in a place with sand that matches the sand found at the crime scene. Looking at the alibis of the students, we see that none of them match this criterion, but when looking closer, we see that Denise's alibi does not have a clear location where she was with her parents after the hospital, which could be a location where the sand could have been picked up. 

However, I see a crucial detail:  the alibis of the other students all have specific locations where they were, and none of these locations match the sand found. But, Denise's alibi is different because she was in a hospital, but we don't know where the hospital was. But, when looking at the story, we see that she said they contacted her parents after she was patched up, but we don't know where she was patched up. However, this detail is crucial: the only time she could have picked up the sand is when she was at the hospital.

"To analyze the evidence and determine who is guilty, I will carefully examine the events and statements made by each suspect.

1. **Captain Kildare's behavior and alibi**: The Captain was initially opposed to trying to row to safety, which could be seen as a sign of a lack of initiative. However, when questioned about the lifeboat's condition, he seemed to be genuinely concerned about the others' safety. His alibi for the time of the murder is shaky, as he was nowhere to be seen when Jensen went missing, and he only returned with information about the oar and bloodstains after Jensen's body was discovered. While this is suspicious, it's not conclusive evidence.

2. **Latrisha Lanigan's behavior and alibi**: Lanigan was very aggressive towards Jensen, which could indicate a motive for murder. She also seemed to be trying to deflect attention from herself by pointing out the lack of weight on Jensen's body, which would allow it to float to the surface. However, her calm demeanor when examining Jensen's body and her earlier argument with Jensen about his behavior during the storm suggest she might be hiding something. Her alibi for the time of the murder is also unclear.

3. **Mark Colson's behavior and alibi**: Colson was openly opposed to waiting for rescue and advocated for taking action to ensure their survival. He made a comment about Jensen's death being a ""good riddance,"" which suggests he had a motive for murder. However, this could also be a red herring to deflect attention. His alibi for the time of the murder is unclear, and he was not seen anywhere near the crime scene.

4. **Marvin Fishback's behavior and alibi**: Fishback initially seemed cooperative but later became defensive when accused of taking food from the provisions chest. He suggested an alternative explanation for Jensen's death (accidentally hitting himself with an oar), which could be a desperate attempt to avoid suspicion. However, his alibi for the time of the murder is also unclear.

**Analysis**: Considering the evidence, I will examine the behavior and motives of each suspect. 

- Captain Kildare's opposition to rowing to safety initially and his lack of an alibi for the time of the murder make him a suspect.
- Latrisha Lanigan's aggressive behavior and calm demeanor when examining the body suggest she might be hiding something.
- Mark Colson's comment about Jensen's death being a ""good riddance"" and his unclear alibi make him a suspect.
- Marvin Fishback's defensive behavior and alternative explanation for Jensen's death make him a suspect.

However, upon closer examination, I notice that the only person who seemed genuinely concerned about the consequences of Jensen's death was **Captain Kildare**. His statement about the currents and the fact that the killer should have weighed down the body to prevent it from rising to the surface suggests he is aware of the significance of the evidence. This indicates that he might be trying to cover his own tracks. Furthermore, his initial opposition to rowing to safety and his lack of alibi for the time of the murder make him a strong suspect.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence carefully and explain my reasoning step by step.

1. **Initial Analysis**: The mystery takes place in New Orleans on December 23, 1814, with the British preparing to invade. The protagonist, Zeb, and his friend Ezekiel are trying to identify the person who is planning to deliver a warning letter to the British commander, which would ruin General Jackson's surprise attack.

2. **Identifying the Suspects**: The suspects are Jean, a privateer; Marie, a small waitress; Molly, the restaurant owner; and Smith, a sailor from Maine.

3. **Analyzing the Evidence**:
   - **Jean**: Jean claims to be a privateer authorized by the U.S. Congress to plunder British ships. However, he is unable to read the letter he claims is from the U.S. Congress. This raises suspicions about his authenticity. Moreover, his behavior seems too carefree, and his laughter is suspicious.
   - **Marie**: Marie seems to be a friendly and lively person, but there is no direct evidence linking her to the British. Her comment about Napoleon wanting the U.S. back seems like a joke, and she doesn't show any signs of being a spy.
   - **Molly**: Molly seems protective of her staff and is quick to defend them. However, her behavior is not suspicious. She also doesn't seem to have any motives to betray the U.S. government.
   - **Smith**: Smith seems like a suspicious character. He is from Maine, which is a state that had threatened to secede from the U.S. He also expresses a desire to trade with the British, which seems counterintuitive to the U.S. interests. Furthermore, his comment about not wanting to fight another war of independence suggests he might be sympathetic to the British cause.

4. **Making the Connection**: Ezekiel whispers to Zeb that he knows who is delivering the warning letter to the British. This implies that Ezekiel has some inside information. When the white-haired gentleman with a long, sharp nose enters the restaurant, Ezekiel seems unconcerned, indicating that he knows the person is not the one they are looking for. This suggests that the person Ezekiel is thinking of is someone already present in the restaurant.

5. **The Final Clue**: When Molly delivers a warm plate to the sailor, Smith, and says, ""Standing so close to you, I can finally see your face, Mr. Smith. And it's an ugly one!"" Molly is being sarcastic and making a joke, but this line stands out because it's the first time she has been close to Smith. This could be a clever way of testing Smith's reaction without arousing suspicion.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis of the evidence, the most suspicious character is Smith. His background, behavior, and comments suggest that he might be working with the British. The final clue about Molly making a joke about Smith's face and being close to him is a clever way of testing his reaction without arousing suspicion. Smith's reaction is to laugh, which might be a sign of guilt.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and follow the instructions.

1. Analyzing the evidence:

- Fiona mentioned that her dollhouse was stolen between the time she woke up in the morning and an hour later.
- There are four suspects: Julia, Kyle, Lucius, and Reg.
- Julia had Reg deliver flowers to the house early in the morning and then sent Lucius to prepare the kitchen.
- When questioned about carrying anything when they arrived, Julia said she had only her clipboard and purse, but her purse was searched and found to have no dollhouse.
- Julia's car was searched and found to have only another clipboard.
- Julia was furious when I suggested searching her car, suggesting she might be hiding something.

2. Explaining the reasoning step by step:

- The dollhouse was stolen between the time Fiona woke up and an hour later, which means the thief must have been in the house during that time.
- Julia was the first person to arrive, but she claimed she was only in the house to deliver flowers and then sent Lucius to prepare the kitchen. However, this doesn't entirely rule her out, as she could have still had time to steal the dollhouse before sending Lucius.
- Julia's behavior when her car was searched was suspicious, as she became furious and seemed defensive.
- Julia's purse and car were searched, but no dollhouse was found. This could be a clever attempt to mislead the investigation.
- Julia's alibi for the time the dollhouse was stolen is shaky at best. She claims she was only in the house to deliver flowers, but she could have easily snuck away to steal the dollhouse.

3. Conclusion:

Given the evidence and my analysis, I believe Julia is the most likely suspect. Her behavior when her car was searched, her shaky alibi, and the fact that no dollhouse was found in her purse or car all point to her guilt. However, we need to consider one more crucial piece of evidence.

Fiona mentioned that the dollhouse was in the den, which had no other exits or windows, except for the entrance from the enormous room. This means that the thief must have entered the den through the enormous room, where the other suspects were gathered.

When questioned about carrying anything when they arrived, Julia said she had only her clipboard and purse. However, when I asked if she had anything else, she didn't mention the dollhouse, which suggests that she might be hiding something.

Considering all the evidence, I believe Julia is the most likely suspect.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. Mark mentions that Macca is his dog, and he had gotten the puppy two years ago. This establishes a strong bond between Mark and Macca, making it less likely that Mark would harm or steal his own dog.

2. When Mark and Taylor see the giant paw print in the snow, Mark immediately recognizes it as belonging to Old Mugger, a giant black bear that had attacked a horse on a nearby farm. This suggests that Mark is aware of the bear's presence in the area and is cautious about it.

3. However, Mark doesn't mention the bear's presence to his parents or Taylor, which seems suspicious. He only shares this information with himself and doesn't act on it. This implies that Mark might be hiding something.

4. Mark and Taylor's encounter with Orville, the mailman, is crucial. Orville is described as being ""fattest"" and claims to be terrified of dogs. He also mentions that his brother breeds dogs and sells them to rich people, which makes him seem suspicious.

5. After Orville leaves, Mark checks the ground for more letters that their mailman had dropped, but Orville is already driving away. This implies that Orville might have been in a hurry to leave the scene.

6. When Mark wakes up the next morning, he discovers that Macca is missing. He runs out to look for clues, but there are no signs of a bear or any other animal. The only clue is the snow-covered yard, which is eerily quiet.

7. Mark's conversation with Taylor suggests that he is considering the possibility of Orville stealing Macca, but he doesn't seem to be considering the bear as a suspect anymore. This implies that Mark has a reason to believe Orville is involved.

8. Mark's father's voice shouting from the house about it being too cold for Mark to be running around outside seems like a red herring to distract from the real issue at hand.

9. Mark's final realization, ""Macca's gone from the back yard. And I know who's responsible!"" implies that he has figured out who took Macca, but the text doesn't reveal who it is.

Considering all the evidence, let's analyze the suspects:

- Mom: There is no evidence to suggest that Mark's mom is involved in Macca's disappearance.
- Old Mugger: Mark recognizes the paw print as belonging to the bear, but he doesn't seem to be considering it as a suspect when he wakes up the next morning.
- Orville: Orville's suspicious behavior, his claim of being terrified of dogs, and his brother's dog breeding business make him a prime suspect.

Based on the analysis, the most likely suspect is Orville, the mailman. Mark's realization that he knows who's responsible implies that he has figured out Orville's involvement. 

GUILTY: Orville",Orville,Taylor,12
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  Four cats in Andy's neighborhood have disappeared, and their owners have searched for them but couldn't find them. This suggests that the cat thief is someone who is able to capture and hide the cats without being detected.
2.  The strange woman, Edith, lives in a big old house across town with over forty cats. This might seem suspicious, but she claims to have a lot of cats and not to steal them from others.
3.  Joshua Sellers, the film producer, is a key figure in the cat food commercial industry and boasts about finding talented cats. However, his house is poorly maintained, and his claim of finding talented cats in Edith's yard raises some questions.
4.  Muggles, Andy's cat, disappears after being trained to fetch a ball of foil, and Andy suspects that Edith might have stolen him. However, Edith seems genuinely concerned and invites Andy inside.
5.  Joshua Sellers arrives at Edith's house and is impressed by the cats, but his behavior seems more like that of a cat collector or trader rather than a genuine animal lover.
6.  Andy notices that Edith hasn't used the cage in months, and it's on top of yesterday's newspaper, which suggests that she might have used it recently.
7.  Joshua Sellers mentions that he flew to New York the previous morning, but he didn't check his voicemail until an hour ago, which seems suspicious, especially since he claims to have 13 unheard voicemail messages.

Considering these points, the most suspicious person is Joshua Sellers. He has a history of finding talented cats, and his behavior at Edith's house seems more like that of a cat collector or trader. His lack of attention to his voicemail and his recent travel to New York also raise suspicions. Additionally, the fact that he claims to have found talented cats in Edith's yard, but his own house is poorly maintained, suggests that he might be using Edith's house as a source of new cats for his commercial projects.

GUILTY: Joshua Sellers",Joshua Sellers,Edith,13
"To analyze the evidence and determine the guilty party, I will break down the key points and provide my reasoning step by step.

1.  **The Legend and the Portrait**: The legend states that if the portrait of the First Earl is turned, the present Earl will die within a day. This has happened twice in the past, but not since the Jacobite rising in 1745. The fact that the portrait was turned before Lord Auchinlech's death suggests that this event may be connected to his demise.

2.  **The Investigation**: I interviewed the family members and staff, and they all had alibis for the time of the crime. However, it's essential to note that alibis can be faked or manipulated.

3.  **The Guests' Behavior**: 
    -   **Jonathan Ingersoll**: He was invited to the castle and given a guest suite. He asked about the legend and was subjected to a withering blast from the late Earl. He was not in a position of power or influence over the Earl, but his curiosity might have led him to take action.
    -   **Lucille Cameron**: She was the only person who got up during the night, heard a noise, and discovered her father's body. Her alibi seems solid, but it's also possible that she was trying to cover up her involvement.
    -   **Marion Montgomery**: He was a distant relative and a social step below his Canadian cousin. He was not invited to stay at the castle but was directed to return after the Earl's death. His presence at the dinner and his interest in the legend could suggest a motive.
    -   **Teddy Auchinlech**: As the late Earl's son, Teddy stood to gain a significant inheritance if his father died. However, his pulmonary condition made it difficult for him to move around, and he seemed to be in a weakened state.

4.  **The Crime Scene**: The fact that the late Earl was found with his right hand rolled into a tight ball over his heart suggests that he was frightened to death. This could indicate that he saw or experienced something that terrified him.

5.  **The Motive**: The motive behind the crime seems to be connected to the legend and the inheritance. However, the fact that the portrait was turned and the late Earl was frightened to death suggests that the killer might have been trying to create a specific scenario rather than simply killing the Earl for the inheritance.

6.  **The Alibis**: While the suspects have alibis, it's essential to consider the possibility of faked or manipulated alibis.

7.  **The Key Evidence**: The fact that the late Earl was found with his hand rolled into a tight ball over his heart and that the portrait was turned suggests that the killer wanted to create a specific scene, possibly to make it look like a case of ""fright to death"" rather than a straightforward murder.

Considering all these points, I will now analyze the behavior and motives of each suspect:

-   **Jonathan Ingersoll**: His curiosity about the legend and his interest in the story might have led him to take action, but it's not clear if he had the means to turn the portrait and kill the Earl.
-   **Lucille Cameron**: Her alibi seems solid, but her interest in the legend and her emotional reaction to her father's death might suggest that she was trying to cover up her involvement.
-   **Marion Montgomery**: His social status and distant relationship to the Earl might have created a sense of resentment, and his presence at the dinner and interest in the legend could suggest a motive. However, there is no clear evidence linking him to the crime scene.
-   **Teddy Auchinlech**: His weakened state due to his pulmonary condition makes it difficult for him to move around, which could suggest that he did not have the capability to turn the portrait and kill the Earl.

Based on the evidence and analysis, I believe that the guilty party is:

GUILTY: Lucille Cameron

My reasoning is as follows: Lucille Cameron was the only person who got up during the night, heard a noise, and discovered her father's body. Her emotional reaction to her father's death and her interest in the legend suggest that she might have been trying to cover up her involvement. Additionally, the fact that she was the only one who got up during the night and discovered the body suggests that she might have been the one who turned the portrait and caused the Earl's death.",Lucille Cameron,Jonathan Ingersoll,14
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who is guilty:

1. **Location and Time**: The incident occurred on Friday afternoon before the judging on Saturday at the park pavilion. Ben was inside the pavilion getting a Coke while his Corvair was parked in front of the entrance.

2. **Ben's Account**: Ben stated that he didn't see anyone come in or out of the pavilion while he was inside. However, he was engaged on a business call and was preoccupied for a short time. This means he might not have been paying attention to his surroundings.

3. **Fresh Oil and Tire Tracks**: Ben noticed fresh oil in the parking place next to his Corvair and tire tracks that were very close to his car. This suggests that the perpetrator might have been in a hurry and didn't clean up the oil or tire tracks properly.

4. **Debbie's Account**: Debbie mentioned that she and Gary went to the grocery store together, which means Gary had an alibi during the time of the incident.

5. **Mike's Account**: Mike claimed that he had a radiator leak in his Mustang and couldn't get it repaired in time for the judging. This could be a valid excuse, but it's also possible that he was trying to deflect attention from himself.

6. **Doc's Account**: Doc said he was washing and waxing his Corvette, which could be a plausible alibi. However, it's worth noting that Doc seemed unhappy with Ben's accusations and might have had a motive to damage Ben's car.

7. **Tommy's Account**: Tommy asked Doc and Mike about their whereabouts during the incident and then asked Ben to admit who he thought was responsible. This suggests that Tommy might be trying to deflect attention from himself or gather information to make an accusation.

Considering the evidence, I notice that Gary has a solid alibi, and his wife Debbie corroborated his story. Mike's excuse for not attending the judging seems plausible, but it's also suspicious that he's trying to deflect attention from himself. Doc's unhappiness with Ben's accusations and his potential motive to damage Ben's car make him a potential suspect. However, Tommy's behavior seems the most suspicious. He asked Doc and Mike about their whereabouts, which suggests he's trying to eliminate them as suspects. Then, he asked Ben to admit who he thought was responsible, which implies that Tommy is trying to make Ben accuse someone else.

Based on this analysis, I believe Tommy Flowers is the most likely suspect. His behavior and questions suggest that he's trying to deflect attention from himself and make it seem like someone else is responsible. Additionally, his emotional response to the situation and his involvement in the discussion make him a more likely suspect.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The crime scene: Ro's body is found in the chicken coop with a bloody stone next to him, and feathers are scattered around the area.
2.  The statement from Bertha: ""Just like they done to my po' Tom. The po' babe, po' boy."" This suggests that Bertha has a history of violence, particularly towards those who have harmed her son.
3.  The location of the money: The money is found sewn into Ro's jacket, which suggests that the killer was aware of Ro's financial situation and wanted to remove the money from him.
4.  The movement of the suspects: Bertha and Tom were missing at the time of the discovery of Ro's body, but they reappeared shortly after.
5.  The evidence on Tom's shoes: The feathers on Tom's shoes suggest that he had been in the chicken coop, and the statement from Bertha that she fell and her son didn't implies that Tom might have been the one who actually went out the window and returned without her.
6.  The alibi of Bertha and Tom: Bertha claims that she heard a scuffle and saw Ro bleeding from his head, but Barley and Joseph claim that they didn't see her pass them. This suggests that Bertha might have been trying to create an alibi.
7.  The motive: The statement from the conductor that Ro was poor and had a fearful temper, and the fact that Bertha's son Tom is also poor and has a temper, suggests that the motive might be related to the financial situation of Ro and the desire to acquire his money.
8.  The actions of the suspects: Bertha's actions and statements suggest that she is trying to cover up her involvement in the crime, while Tom's innocent and childlike behavior suggests that he might be telling the truth.
9.  The final statement from the Reverend: ""It is obvious who killed him."" This suggests that the Reverend has made up his mind and has evidence that points to one of the suspects.

Considering all these points, I conclude that the evidence points to Bertha as the killer. The feathers on Tom's shoes suggest that he was in the chicken coop, but his innocent behavior and the fact that he was trying to get a chicken for his mother suggest that he might have been in the chicken coop for a different reason. Bertha's alibi and her statement about seeing Ro bleeding from his head are suspicious, and her history of violence towards those who have harmed her son suggests that she might have a motive for the crime. The fact that the Reverend has made up his mind and has evidence that points to one of the suspects also suggests that Bertha is the killer.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **Jane Neal's Story:** Jane claims to have traveled around the country in an old tour bus with a group of Ken Kesey style merry pranksters after high school graduation. However, Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters gained popularity in the late 1960s, but Jane claims to have done this after high school graduation, which would be before the late 1960s. This inconsistency raises a red flag.

2. **Larry Gerard's Story:** Larry claims to have spent almost 30 years in the US State Department, including time abroad, and now lives in Texas, spending time at the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library in Houston. However, Lyndon B. Johnson was not president until 1963, and Larry claims to have spent almost 30 years in the State Department. This would mean he started working in the State Department in the early 1960s, around the time of Terry's childhood and friendship with Larry. However, Terry and Rochelle moved to a different neighborhood in the summer of 1961, and they lost touch with Larry. This timeline doesn't add up, as Larry would have been too young to be in the State Department for almost 30 years.

3. **Paula Newsome's Story:** Paula claims to have produced the Bicentennial Minutes television segments from 1974-76 and won an Emmy award. However, the Bicentennial Minutes series won an Emmy award in 1977, but it was produced in 1976. This minor inconsistency doesn't seem significant at first glance, but we can come back to it later.

4. **Billy Flowers' Story:** Billy claims to have moved to New York in 1975 and voted for Barry Goldwater in the last presidential election before moving to New York. However, Barry Goldwater ran for president in 1964, and it's unlikely that Billy would have voted for him in the last presidential election before moving to New York, as that would have been the 1972 election. Billy also claims to have voted for Jimmy Carter in 1976, which is plausible.

5. **Jimmy Smith's Story:** Jimmy claims to have been in a car accident in 1981 and opened his own rehabilitation center with his second wife Charlene. This story seems consistent and plausible.

Now, let's review the evidence:

* Jane Neal's story has an inconsistency about the timing of her travels.
* Larry Gerard's story has a timeline issue with his employment in the State Department.
* Paula Newsome's story has a minor inconsistency about the Emmy award.
* Billy Flowers' story has a potential issue with the timing of his presidential votes.
* Jimmy Smith's story seems consistent and plausible.

However, upon closer examination, we can see that all the suspects have some inconsistencies or potential issues with their stories. But, if we look at the minor inconsistencies, we can see that Paula Newsome's story has the least severe inconsistency, and her story about the Emmy award is the most minor.

Given the context of the story, it seems that Terry is trying to trick Rochelle into figuring out who is telling the truth. However, based on the analysis, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact guilty person.

However, if I had to choose, I would say that **GUILTY: Paula Newsome**. The reason is that Paula's story has the least severe inconsistency, and her story about the Emmy award is the most minor. Additionally, Paula's story seems to be the most polished and well-rehearsed, which could indicate that she is trying to hide something. However, this is just a hunch, and the other suspects have their own inconsistencies and potential issues with their stories.","Paula Newsome**.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence carefully and follow the steps.

**Step 1: Analyze the letter from Joan Colthrop**

The letter reveals that Joan had split the check with Grace at luncheon, but then she and Laura went shopping together. After that, Joan went to the matinee at the Bijou Theater, while Grace and Maybelle went shopping together. The letter also mentions that Joan's MasterCard was missing, and there were unauthorized charges for a cashmere robe and shoes.

**Step 2: Investigate the credit card purchases**

Crusher visits Keith's Shoes and the Maple Street Fashion Shop and finds that the salesgirls remembered a tall young woman making the purchases. However, the signature on the credit card receipt at the Maple Street Fashion Shop matches the one at Keith's Shoes. This suggests that the same person made both purchases.

**Step 3: Analyze the suspects' behavior**

- **Grace Means**: She and Maybelle went shopping together after luncheon, but there is no indication that Grace was the one who made the credit card purchases.
- **Joan Colthrop**: She had split the check with Grace and then went shopping with Laura. She also went to the matinee at the Bijou Theater, which would have given her an alibi for the time the credit card purchases were made.
- **Laura Parsons**: She went shopping with Joan, but there is no indication that she was the one who made the credit card purchases.
- **Maybelle Johnson**: She and Grace went shopping together, and Maybelle is described as being tall, like Joan. This makes her a likely candidate for the thief.

**Step 4: Consider the motives**

Maybelle is described as someone who likes what's on the other side of the fence, and she has been making passes at Joan's boyfriend, Steve Cartwright. This suggests that Maybelle may be motivated to steal Joan's MasterCard to buy expensive items.

**Conclusion**

Based on the evidence and analysis, the most likely suspect is **Maybelle Johnson**. She matches the description of the person who made the credit card purchases, and her behavior suggests that she may be motivated to steal from Joan.",Unknown,Joan Colthrop,18
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The first clue is that the thefts occurred at the following locations: Home Depot, Safeway, and The Elegant Jewelry Shop. At each location, a wallet was stolen, and the money was taken, but the credit cards were left behind. This suggests that the thief was looking for cash and didn't need the credit cards.

2.  Inspector Samuels mentions that Sam Cartwright is a large man and could have used the credit cards to make more money. However, the thief didn't take the credit cards, which implies that the thief wasn't looking to use them for financial gain.

3.  The second clue is that the four high school students, Sarah Browne, Morris Emerson, Johnny Anderson, and Tom Blankenship, were at each of the locations where the thefts occurred. However, they were not together at the Safeway when Charley Eastern's wallet was stolen, and Sarah was not present.

4.  The third clue is that at The Elegant Jewelry Shop, Mayor Greenleaf was wearing a jacket with his wallet in the inside right pocket. The students were together in the store, but Mayor Greenleaf left the store first, and his wallet was found on the sidewalk. This suggests that the thief could have been in the group of students.

5.  The fourth clue is that at Home Depot, Sam Cartwright saw the four students in the store, and Johnny was having an argument with another customer over an electric sander. Morris went to calm them down, and Sarah and Tom were at the checkout counter after Sam Cartwright.

6.  The students later confess to the crime, but they claim that they all took the wallets and planned to return the money. However, this doesn't explain the pattern of the thefts, as the money was taken in each case.

7.  The key to the mystery lies in the fact that the students were rehearsing the play ""Oliver Twist"" and were inspired to stage a mock pickpocketing scene. However, the evidence suggests that only one of the students was the actual thief.

8.  The crucial clue is that Mayor Greenleaf was wearing a jacket with his wallet in the inside right pocket. If the thief was one of the students, it would have been difficult for them to access the wallet without being noticed.

9.  Considering the evidence, it's clear that the students were rehearsing their pickpocketing scenes, and one of them was inspired to actually steal the wallets. However, the fact that the wallets were not thoroughly searched and the credit cards were left behind suggests that the thief was not motivated by financial gain.

10.  The most likely explanation is that the students were indeed rehearsing their play, but only one of them was the actual thief. The fact that the wallets were not thoroughly searched and the credit cards were left behind suggests that the thief was not motivated by financial gain, but rather by the thrill of the crime.

11.  Considering the evidence, the most likely suspect is Morris Emerson, who was the one who went to calm down the argument between Johnny and the other customer at Home Depot. This suggests that Morris was the one who was not part of the main group, but was close enough to be involved in the crime.

12.  Additionally, Morris was playing the role of Fagin in the play, who is the leader of the pickpocket gang. This suggests that Morris was the one who was most invested in the play and was more likely to be the actual thief.

"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **The Footprints**: Mrs. Smith points out a line of muddy footprints on the carpet that match the tread of John's boots. These footprints lead from the doorway to the center of the room where the trolley was and then out again. This seems to be a strong piece of evidence against John.

2. **John's Silence**: When asked about the footprints, John falls silent, which suggests that he might be hiding something.

3. **The Broken Window**: Mr. Seppings notices that the window was open and damaged in a way that would be difficult to do without causing additional damage, which would result in being fired. He also mentions that there are no ladder marks to be seen. This suggests that the person who opened the window might be someone who didn't need to use a ladder to reach it.

4. **Break Times**: Jake mentions that Lewis and John had a break together at 2:30, which is around the time the diamond was likely stolen (since the police were not informed until later that day). This could indicate that one of these two might have been in the living room during the break.

5. **Window Accessibility**: Since the window is six feet off the ground, it would be difficult for someone like Lewis (over six feet tall) to open it without causing damage, as he would have to climb up to reach it. However, Horace (slightly over five feet) could potentially open the window without needing to climb up.

6. **Break Times and Window Opening**: Jake and Horace had their break together at 11, but the window was likely opened after 2:30 (when Lewis and John had their break). This means that Horace could have opened the window after his break, which would explain the lack of ladder marks.

Considering all the evidence, we can now make some connections:

* John's silence and the muddy footprints suggest he might be involved, but it's not conclusive.
* The broken window and the lack of ladder marks suggest that someone who doesn't need to use a ladder to reach it might have opened it.
* Lewis's size and the fact that he had a break with John around the time the diamond was likely stolen make him a suspect, but the broken window seems to point more towards Horace.
* Jake's break with Horace at 11 and their subsequent break in the kitchen together don't seem to provide a clear motive or opportunity for Jake to open the window.

Based on the evidence, the most likely culprit is:

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  Initial Information:
    - Andy and Matthew are playing a game of hide-and-seek.
    - The father suspects that Matthew is hiding, but Andy knows where he is.
    - The father asks Andy to reveal the location of Matthew, but Andy refuses to tell him directly.

2.  Analyzing the Clues:
    - The father asks Andy where he and Matthew have been, and Andy mentions several locations: Matthew's room, his own room, the garage, the tree house, and the hall closet.
    - The father notices grass stains on Andy's feet and chocolate remnants around his lips, suggesting that Andy has been outside and eating a chocolate bar.
    - The father also notices a big water spill in Andy's room, which was made earlier that morning when Andy dropped an uncovered glass of water.
    - The father finds the garage floor to be dirty and oily, which is a reason why he doesn't want the kids to go there without adult supervision.

3.  Eliminating Possibilities:
    - The hall closet is unlikely to be the hiding spot because the father had seen the door open and shut earlier in the afternoon, and it's unlikely that Matthew would be hiding in a closet that's easily accessible.
    - Matthew's room is also unlikely because the closet is open, and there's no other furniture in the room that could provide a hiding spot.
    - The tree house is unlikely because the father is already wet from walking through the grass, and it's unlikely that Matthew would be hiding in a location that would get the father wet.

4.  Final Analysis:
    - The only location that's left is the garage, but the father has a reason to be hesitant to suspect the garage as the hiding spot.
    - However, the father's hesitation to suspect the garage might be a clever ploy to distract from the real hiding spot.
    - The father's reaction when he says, ""Let's go back into the house"" after inspecting the garage suggests that he knows Matthew is hiding in the garage, but he's trying to keep Andy from guessing.
    - The fact that the father knows exactly where Matthew is hiding and says, ""Let's go get him"" implies that he's been playing along with the game and has been aware of Matthew's hiding spot all along.

5.  Conclusion:
    Based on the evidence and the father's reactions, it's likely that Matthew is hiding in the garage. However, the father is trying to keep Andy from guessing, so he's pretending to look for him in other locations. The father's behavior suggests that he's aware of Matthew's hiding spot, but he's playing along with the game to keep Andy engaged.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who stole the wristwatch.

1.  The investigation begins with the discovery that the wristwatch is missing from its hiding place in the guest cottage. Lorraine Wellington reports that she checked it early in the morning and it was gone.
2.  Josie and her mother had been to the guest cottage the previous night, and Josie reveals that she knew about the hiding place. However, Lorraine claims that only she, her husband Lester, and Josie's mother had a key to the cottage. This implies that Cindy, the maid, did not have a key, but we later find out that she actually did have a key.
3.  The police officer suggests that Josie's mother might have used the key to steal the watch, but Josie retorts that her mother is trying to make her dream come true by starting a business. However, this doesn't necessarily rule out the possibility of Josie's mother being involved.
4.  The investigation then shifts to Cindy, the maid, who claims that she started cleaning at 8 am and finished by 4 pm. She also claims that she didn't notice anything out of order in the guest cottage when she left for the day. However, this alibi doesn't seem entirely convincing, as Cindy's story could be fabricated.
5.  Lorraine Wellington is also a suspect, but her behavior seems more emotional and worried than manipulative. She seems genuinely concerned about the theft of her watch and is offering a reward for its return.
6.  Lester, on the other hand, is more suspicious. He arrives at the scene with an expensive pair of golf clubs, seemingly unbothered by the police presence. He also jokes about getting a police escort as a gift, which seems insensitive given the situation. Furthermore, when the police question him, he doesn't seem particularly concerned about the theft of the watch.
7.  Considering all the evidence, it seems that Lester Wellington is the most likely culprit. He had access to the guest cottage, seemed unbothered by the police presence, and made a joke about getting a police escort as a gift. This behavior suggests that he might be involved in the theft.

"To analyze the evidence and determine who is guilty, let's break down the key points from the story:

1. **Murder Timeframe**: The murder occurred around 12 hours before the body was discovered, which was around 10 am. The victim, Tim Randall, had a luncheon scheduled with Sarah Conrad at 12:30 pm, but it's unlikely that Sarah could have committed the crime and then attended the luncheon.

2. **Luncheon with Sarah Conrad**: Sarah Conrad had a luncheon scheduled with Tim Randall, but she claimed she hadn't seen him since high school and was looking forward to seeing him. However, she didn't mention any plans to meet him the night before the murder, which raises suspicions.

3. **Motivation for Murder**: Morris Ingalls mentioned that Tim Randall said, ""She'll never be on the Supreme Court - I can fix that!"" when referring to Sarah Conrad. This implies that Tim Randall might have had some information or leverage that could have impacted Sarah's career ambitions.

4. **Opportunity**: All four suspects were in the vicinity of the bed and breakfast where Tim Randall was staying. However, Randolph Johnson's alibi for the time of the murder is shaky, as he claimed to have taken off his contact lenses and couldn't be sure if he saw Tim Randall in the washroom.

5. **Means and Opportunity**: The B and B pen knife used to kill Tim Randall was available in each bedroom, making it accessible to all suspects.

6. **Personality and Behavior**: Morris Ingalls had a clear motive to dislike Tim Randall due to their past and their college roommate relationship. He also seemed nervous and agitated during the interview.

7. **Consistency**: Sarah Conrad's story about not seeing Tim Randall since high school seems inconsistent with her reaction to his death. She seemed to be looking forward to seeing him, which could indicate that she had a motive to kill him.

8. **Physical Evidence**: There is no direct physical evidence linking any of the suspects to the crime scene.

After analyzing the evidence, I believe the most likely suspect is:

GUILTY: Sarah Conrad",Sarah Conrad,Morris Ingalls,23
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who is guilty.

1.  Amy and Barry's conversation suggests that a hacker might try to manipulate the votes by replacing the original votes with fake ones on a special data drive. This information seems to come from Barry's friend, who overheard a conversation about it in the computer lab.
2.  The list of students who signed in to the computer lab has three names: Ricky Churrelo, Xavier Ericksen, and Simon Knowles. Barry thinks that Ricky might be the hacker because he's been talking about politics and wrote an editorial for the school newspaper supporting Ron Paul.
3.  However, when Amy and Barry go to Ricky's dorm room, they find out that Ricky is not there. His roommate says that Ricky had a final exam and went to the computer lab to study.
4.  Barry then calls his friend to ask about Simon Knowles, and the friend seems hesitant to answer. This could indicate that Barry might know something about Simon's involvement.
5.  Barry then asks about Xavier Ericksen and learns that he lives in the building next door. However, when they go to Xavier's dorm room, they find that he is not there, but the athlete who answers the door mentions that Xavier is with his tutor.
6.  Amy then goes to Simon's house, where she finds out that he and his friends have left in a pickup truck about 10 minutes ago.
7.  However, it is also mentioned that Xavier is struggling in school and needs to pass two tests this week, which might be a motive for him to hack the votes to get the desired outcome.

Now, let's analyze the evidence again and consider the following:

-   Ricky is not in the computer lab when Amy and Barry go to investigate, which could be a red herring to distract from the real culprit.
-   Barry seems to know more about Simon Knowles than he lets on, which raises suspicions about his involvement.
-   Xavier is struggling in school and needs to pass two tests, which could be a motive for him to hack the votes to get the desired outcome.

Based on the evidence, I would say that the guilty person is Xavier Ericksen. His motive is clear, and his absence from his dorm room when Amy and Barry investigate also suggests that he might be the one behind the hacking.",Unknown,Simon Knowles,24
"Let's analyze the evidence carefully and determine who is guilty.

1.  **Physical Evidence:** There is no physical evidence presented in the story to directly implicate any of the suspects.
2.  **Behavioral Evidence:** 
    -   **Caleb** was described as ""worried"" this morning, but this was a habitual trait of his, and it's unclear if it's related to skipping class.
    -   **Connor** had a dramatic turnaround in his study habits and class attendance after Coach Hastings offered him a full athletic scholarship. He was the oldest and had previously been described as ""lackadaisical."" There's no indication that he would intentionally skip class now.
    -   **Jordan** suffers from Hypoglycemia and has passed out at school several times. This condition could cause him to feel weak and faint, which might make it seem like he skipped class, but it's unclear if this is the case.
    -   **Kyle** is described as having attention span problems and not doing well in school. He is also described as not being a troublemaker, and he has a desire to get along with his teachers and the vice principal. This suggests that he might be more likely to skip class, as he's not motivated to succeed academically.
3.  **Circumstantial Evidence:**
    -   Amanda suspected that one of her sons had skipped class before even speaking to Marge. She didn't seem hesitant or unsure about who it was, which suggests that she had a strong intuition or inside knowledge about the situation.
    -   Amanda knew the boys' schedules and daily routines, which would make it more likely for her to know who was absent.
    -   Marge, the receptionist, didn't seem to be surprised when Amanda told her who she suspected had skipped class, which suggests that Amanda's suspicion was plausible and likely correct.
4.  **Psychological Profile:**
    -   Amanda's intuition and knowledge of her sons' habits and personalities are crucial in determining who skipped class.
    -   The fact that she didn't seem surprised or uncertain when she suspected Kyle suggests that she has insight into his behavior and motivations.

Considering the evidence, I believe that Amanda's intuition and knowledge of her sons' habits and personalities point to **Kyle** as the most likely suspect. His attention span problems and lack of motivation to succeed academically make it more likely that he would skip class.

GUILTY: Kyle",Kyle,Caleb,25
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who let the frogs out.

1. **Timeframe:** The frogs escaped sometime after 4:00 pm on the day before the mystery occurred. The last person to leave the classroom before the escape was Kyle Kravetsky, who claimed to have left around 5:00 pm to refill Bunsen burners in the chemistry lab.
2. **Access to the classroom and storage room:** Both the classroom door and storage room door were found unlocked the next morning. However, Sergio Ramos, the night custodian, was supposed to lock the doors at 6:00 pm. This implies that the person who let the frogs out had access to the keys or could have left the doors unlocked earlier.
3. **Kyle's alibi:** Kyle claimed to have locked the doors after he left the classroom at 5:00 pm. However, Mr. Womback is unsure if he actually locked the doors, and Kyle's nervous behavior when questioned about the frogs' disappearance suggests he might be hiding something.
4. **Matilda's involvement:** Matilda was one of the last people to interact with the frogs, and she was eager to get paid for her efforts in catching them. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the escape.
5. **Sergio's behavior:** Sergio was already in trouble with Mr. Womback for not doing his job properly the night before. He had an opportunity to let the frogs out, but it's unclear if he would have had the time or motivation to do so.
6. **Marnie's motives:** Marnie is an animal activist who protests the use of animals in experiments. While this might suggest she would want the frogs to escape, there is no direct evidence linking her to the incident.
7. **Fingerprints and other physical evidence:** There is no mention of any physical evidence, such as fingerprints or DNA, that could have been used to identify the culprit.

Based on the analysis, the most likely suspect is **Kyle Kravetsky**. His nervous behavior when questioned, his unclear alibi, and the fact that he was the last person to interact with the frogs before they escaped make him the most suspicious. Additionally, his desire for a $100 advance from Mr. Womback and his reluctance to help with the frogs earlier in the story suggest that he might have had a motive to get rid of the frogs.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. The narrator mentions that he was asleep during the dolphin show and woke up to find himself soaked in cold salt water. This event occurred before the events at the restroom. Therefore, it is not related to the missing phone.

2. The narrator then goes to the restroom with the kids, where Collin is hesitant to go, but eventually, they all go in. This is the last time the narrator mentions being with all four kids together.

3. After the narrator sends Collin to the hand dryers and tells him to wait, he goes to change his shirt while the other kids use the restroom facilities. This is when the narrator's phone goes missing.

4. The narrator mentions that Collin was waiting by the door, and Rory was in the stall. However, when the narrator asks the kids about the phone, he doesn't mention Rory as a suspect.

5. The narrator makes a bet with the kids that he can guess who found the phone and where, and they agree to a one-question limit. He asks about their desired ice cream flavors, which is not a relevant question to the case.

6. The narrator orders a triple cone for himself, implying that he knows who found the phone.

Now, let's look at the kids' actions during this time:

- Collin was waiting by the door, which means he was not in the stall.
- Rory was in the stall, which could be a possible location for the phone.
- Erica and Rusty were not mentioned to be in the stall at the time of the phone's disappearance.

Considering these points, it is likely that Rory was the one who took the phone.",Unknown,Rory,27
"To determine the guilty person, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Betty Grable's Appearance at the Funeral**: The key piece of evidence is Betty Grable's appearance at Ernie's funeral. Grandpa and the other sailors were surprised to see her there, as she was married to a trumpeter from 1943 to 1965. This suggests that someone must have set up her appearance at the funeral.

2. **Doug's Reaction**: Doug was ""flabbergasted"" when he saw Betty Grable, and he began questioning Ernie's family about whether Ernie had secretly married her. This reaction implies that Doug was in on the plan to have Betty Grable appear at the funeral.

3. **Doug's Behavior**: After seeing Betty Grable, Doug grilled Ernie's family about whether Ernie had secretly married her. He eventually apologized for underestimating Ernie, which suggests that he was trying to cover his tracks.

4. **Captain Stark's Role**: Captain Stark told Doug to stop acting like a ""jackass"" and eventually told him to apologize. This suggests that Captain Stark was aware of Doug's behavior and was trying to rein him in.

5. **Chet's Behavior**: Chet was present at the funeral and signed the guest book, which suggests that he was also aware of the plan to have Betty Grable appear.

6. **Ernie's Character**: Ernie was a young sailor who made up a story about being married to Betty Grable to impress his fellow sailors. This suggests that he might be capable of fabricating stories, but it's unlikely that he would set up his own funeral with a fake appearance by his ""wife"".

7. **Grandpa's Character**: Grandpa is a reliable narrator who has a good memory of the events. He's not trying to cover up anything and seems to be telling the truth.

Considering these points, the most likely culprit is Doug, who was the only one who seemed to be in on the plan to have Betty Grable appear at the funeral. His behavior and reaction suggest that he was the mastermind behind the plan.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The can of popcorn was missing from Tom's bunk when he returned from guard duty. The hooch was clean, with no empty drink or beer cans, suggesting that the popcorn was taken recently.
2.  Tom noticed water on the floor and cheese-flavored kernels scattered in the aisle near his bunk. This suggests that the popcorn was opened and eaten in the hooch.
3.  Tom's friends, Mosier, Henson, Macnamara, and Locke, were found huddled near his bunk with sheepish expressions. This implies that they were trying to hide something from Tom.
4.  Locke said he hadn't seen the popcorn, Macnamara said it was by Tom's bunk last he saw it, and Henson said nothing. Mosier looked down and avoided eye contact with Tom.
5.  Tom asked his friends about their activities after chow, and they provided alibis:
    - Macnamara wrote a letter home and played ball with B squad.
    - Locke went to the other side of the camp to watch the movie, taking his M-16 rifle with him.
    - Mosier went to the showers to wash his clothes.
    - Henson had a couple of beers at the club.
6.  Locke mentioned watching ""Buena Sera, Mrs. Campbell"" at the movie, which Tom knew was a film starring Gina Lollobrigida. This suggests that Locke was trying to appear as though he was not paying attention to Tom's popcorn, but was actually trying to deflect attention.
7.  When Tom asked if they had eaten the popcorn, Henson's guilty buddy smiled back at him, implying that Henson was not the one who ate the popcorn.

Based on the evidence, I will now analyze the alibis provided by each suspect:

*   Macnamara's alibi checks out. He was playing ball with B squad, which is a plausible activity for someone who wants to stay out of trouble.
*   Locke's alibi is suspicious. He took his M-16 rifle to the movie, which is unusual behavior, especially considering the danger of the situation. He also seemed to be trying to deflect attention by mentioning the movie.
*   Mosier's alibi seems straightforward, but it's unlikely that someone would go to the showers just to wash their clothes without any other motivation.
*   Henson's alibi is also suspicious. He had a couple of beers at the club, which could have given him the opportunity to eat the popcorn. However, his buddy smiled back at Tom, implying that Henson was not the one who ate the popcorn.

Considering the evidence, I believe that Locke's alibi is the most suspicious. His behavior and the fact that he took his M-16 rifle to the movie raise red flags. Additionally, his attempt to deflect attention by mentioning the movie suggests that he is trying to hide something.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who is guilty.

1. **Evidence of James Macready's death**: The local innkeeper in Scotland mentions that the last Macready family member, James Macready, was lost on the moor in 1844. However, the family's American genealogy suggests that James Macready was born in Scotland in 1823 and died in Pennsylvania in 1863, fighting in the Civil War. This creates a discrepancy in the timeline, suggesting that James Macready did not die on the moor in 1844.

2. **The scarf and its significance**: Lucille Doone gave James Macready a scarf, which was later found tied to a tree branch on the moor. This suggests that James Macready was indeed on the moor, but it does not necessarily imply his death. It could be that he left the scarf as a symbol of his love for Lucille or to mislead others.

3. **The disappearance of the other suitors**: Jack MacGinnis left the dance first, grumbling about the lateness of the hour. James Macready left next, going over the treacherous moor. Tom Jenkins was the last to leave, but there is no indication that he was involved in James' disappearance.

4. **The suspicious behavior of Tom Jenkins**: Tom Jenkins was a hot-blooded and skilled shooter, and he was the last person to leave the dance. His English background and his rifle also raise suspicions. However, there is no direct evidence linking him to James' disappearance.

5. **The suspicious behavior of Jack MacGinnis**: Jack MacGinnis was known to be a rough and ready man, and his brother Samuel Doone was protective of his sister Lucille. Jack's behavior of leaving early, grumbling about the hour, and the fact that he always went out with his dogs, which were heard barking as he walked away, suggest that he might have had a motive to harm James Macready.

6. **The disappearance of Lucille and the other suitors**: After James' disappearance, Lucille moved to Glasgow, and the other suitors, Jack and Tom, left the village. This could be a coincidence, but it also raises suspicions that they might have been involved in James' disappearance.

7. **The lack of evidence**: Despite the search party's efforts, there were no clues found about James' disappearance. This lack of evidence could be due to the treacherous moor conditions, but it also raises suspicions that someone might have intentionally destroyed evidence.

Considering all the evidence, the most suspicious person is Jack MacGinnis. His behavior on the night of the dance, his rough and ready nature, and the fact that he left early, grumbling about the hour, all raise suspicions about his involvement in James' disappearance. Additionally, the fact that he left with his dogs, which were heard barking as he walked away, suggests that he might have had a motive to harm James.

"Let's analyze the evidence carefully:

1.  Mr. Ferguson's behavior: Mr. Ferguson has been searching for ""Curious George and the Pizza"" every day, which suggests that he really wants the book. However, he never actually tries to take the book, and he seems to be content with checking out a different book. This behavior suggests that he might be trying to mislead the librarian and the others.

2.  The library's anti-crime system: The system is supposed to prevent theft by triggering an alarm if someone tries to leave the library with a stolen book. However, the system has a flaw: it only tracks adult books and mysteries, and it doesn't work for children's books. This means that if the thief is someone who regularly checks out children's books, they might be able to avoid triggering the alarm.

3.  The sheriff's visit: The sheriff's wife wants to read ""Curious George and the Pizza"" to the governor's kids, and the sheriff is desperate to find the book. However, when he checks the children's section, the book is missing.

4.  Mrs. Yee's behavior: Mrs. Yee seems to be annoyed by Mr. Ferguson's constant requests for the book and threatens to feed the book to her dog if he continues to make noise in the library. This behavior suggests that she might have a motive to hide the book.

5.  Dexter's behavior: Dexter seems to be smug and proud of the library's anti-crime system, but when Mrs. Yee mentions that the system shorted a fuse last Wednesday, he grumbles quietly. This suggests that he might be hiding something.

6.  The evidence of the shorted fuse: The fact that the system shorted a fuse last Wednesday suggests that someone might have tampered with the system to prevent it from working properly.

Considering all the evidence, the most likely culprit is Dexter. Here's why:

- Dexter seems to be smug and proud of the library's anti-crime system, which suggests that he might be hiding something.
- He grumbled quietly when Mrs. Yee mentioned the shorted fuse, which suggests that he might be involved in tampering with the system.
- He seems to be trying to deflect suspicion from himself by suggesting that Skyler might have stolen the book.
- He is the one who has access to the system and the technical knowledge to tamper with it.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence carefully and explain my reasoning step by step.

1. **Evidence 1: Dillon's Saxophone Was Left on a Stand**
Dillon claims that he left his saxophone on a stand every afternoon for 30 years and always locked the door and window. This suggests that the thief must have had access to the apartment without breaking in.

2. **Evidence 2: The Fire Escape**
The fire escape is broken and cannot be lowered to the ground. The ground below the fire escape has a small flower bed, indicating that no one has used the fire escape to climb up or down in a long time. This eliminates the possibility of someone using the fire escape to steal the saxophone.

3. **Evidence 3: The Building Manager**
The building manager is rarely seen and has a key to the apartment. However, the residents of the building have never seen him, and it's likely that he's not responsible for maintaining the fire escape. His absence and lack of involvement in the building's maintenance suggest that he's not the most likely suspect.

4. **Evidence 4: Lenny's Alibi**
Lenny, the grocery delivery boy, is struggling to put tomatoes in a sack and is under his father's strict supervision. It's unlikely that he had time to steal the saxophone and return to his duties without being noticed.

5. **Evidence 5: Eric's Motive and Opportunity**
Eric has a clear motive to steal the saxophone, as he's researching the history of the neighborhood and is aware of the saxophone's value. He also had access to Dillon's phone number through Red's music store, which suggests that he had an opportunity to plan and execute the theft.

6. **Evidence 6: Eric's Excitement and Red's Warning**
Eric is excited about the saxophone's value and history, and Red warns that there are collectors who would be willing to pay a lot of money for the instrument. This suggests that Eric might have been tempted by the saxophone's value and saw an opportunity to steal it.

7. **Evidence 7: Red's Involvement**
Red gave Eric Dillon's phone number, which suggests that Red was facilitating Eric's research. However, Red's warning about the saxophone's value could also be a red herring to distract from his own involvement in the theft.

**Analysis:** While Red's involvement is suspicious, the evidence points more strongly to Eric as the thief. Eric had a clear motive, opportunity, and the means to steal the saxophone. His excitement about the saxophone's value and history, combined with Red's warning about collectors, suggest that Eric might have been tempted by the saxophone's value and saw an opportunity to steal it.

**Conclusion:** Based on the evidence, I believe that the thief is Eric, the college student researching the history of the neighborhood. He had a clear motive, opportunity, and the means to steal the saxophone, and his excitement about the instrument's value and history suggests that he might have been tempted by its worth.

"To determine who shot Mom, I'll analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The family's routine is well-established: Dad takes Misty for a walk at 8:00 p.m., Mom gets ready, and they leave after ""All in the Family"" ends at 8:30 p.m. 
2.  On the night of the incident, Dad takes Misty for a walk at 8:00 p.m. and returns home on time. He then sits down in the family room to watch ""All in the Family.""
3.  Mom is getting ready to leave when the incident occurs. She is not yet downstairs, which means she is not the one who tampered with the faucet.
4.  The person who tampered with the faucet had to do it before 8:17 p.m., as the dishes from dessert were still in the family room at that time. This is because Dad yelled for Mom to hurry up at 8:17 p.m.
5.  The person who tampered with the faucet also had to do it before 8:28 p.m., as the incident occurs right after Mom heads down the stairs and starts washing the dishes.
6.  Roger is on the phone with his girlfriend, Ginger, during the show. This means he is occupied and cannot be the one who tampered with the faucet.
7.  The person who tampered with the faucet had to be able to get past Dad in the family room and access the kitchen without being noticed. 
8.  The only person who could have done this is the one who was not in the family room with Dad. Since Dad and Roger are in the family room, and Mom is not yet downstairs, the only person left is the narrator, who was in charge of putting the dinner dishes into the dishwasher and washing the pots and pans.

Based on the above analysis, the person who tampered with the faucet and shot Mom with water is the narrator, Randy.

"To analyze the evidence and determine the guilty person, let's break down the information provided:

1.  The security officer from the first floor reported that a person with long hair borrowed a broom, paper towels, and Windex on Friday. This is interesting, as it implies that the thief might have been trying to create a distraction or make it seem like they were doing something else in the office.
2.  Nan had moved her office from floor three to floor five, and the group was in the process of settling into their new space. This could have created an opportunity for someone to take the money without being noticed.
3.  Nan had left her office unlocked for a period of time, which allowed the thief to access the money.
4.  James was in his old cubicle and setting up his new one on Friday afternoon, which seems like a plausible alibi.
5.  Linda was on the phone with a client most of the afternoon and only left her cubicle to get a cold drink, which seems like a strong alibi.
6.  Justin was moving the copy machine and had to deal with the ink cartridge spill, which would have taken up most of his afternoon.
7.  Lincoln helped move Nan's furniture and checked the desk drawers to make sure they were locked, which seems like a solid alibi.

However, there are a few inconsistencies in the alibis:

- James said he was cleaning out his old cubicle and setting up his new one. But, Nan mentioned that James was normally the messiest person in the office, which seems contradictory to his alibi.
- Linda said she was on the phone with a client, but she didn't mention checking in with anyone or confirming her alibi. This raises some questions about her alibi.
- Justin's alibi seems strong, but it's possible that he could have taken a break and returned to the office to steal the money.
- Lincoln's alibi seems solid, but it's possible that he could have taken advantage of the unlocked door to steal the money.

However, there's one crucial piece of evidence that stands out:

- Nan mentioned that she was not happy to announce that the flower fund was missing, and she had been delighted with her new office. This suggests that she might have been trying to hide something, or perhaps she was trying to create a distraction.

Given the inconsistencies in the alibis and the suspicious behavior of Nan, it's possible that Nan herself is the guilty person. However, this would mean that the entire story is a ruse to distract from her own guilt.

Upon closer inspection, there's a more likely explanation:

- Nan had initially mentioned that the security officer from the first floor reported that a person with long hair borrowed some items on Friday. This could be a misdirection, but it's also possible that Nan was the one who borrowed those items.
- Nan had moved her office from floor three to floor five, which would have given her access to the first floor and the ability to take the money without being noticed.
- Nan had left her office unlocked for a period of time, which would have allowed her to take the money without being detected.

Considering these points, it's possible that Nan is trying to deflect attention from her own guilt. However, the most likely explanation is that Nan is trying to distract everyone from her own guilt by making it seem like one of her employees is the thief.

However, this is not a correct solution to the mystery. A more likely solution would be:

- Nan had told her employees that the flower fund was locked in a file cabinet, behind her bookcase. However, if Nan had really locked it there, she would have had to unlock it to access the fund on Friday. But if she said it was locked, but didn't actually lock it, then the money would have been easily accessible.

Given this new information, it's likely that the person who took the money was someone who knew that the fund wasn't actually locked, and took advantage of this to steal the money.

Considering the evidence, it seems that the most likely suspect is:

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

Step 1: Analyze the description of the first traveler, Edward, who was wearing a heavy cotton shirt and had mud on his trousers and bare feet. He seemed to be a farmer, and his discomfort due to the heat and mosquitoes suggested that he was not a person who would be traveling in a hurry or with a purpose.

Step 2: Analyze the description of the second traveler, Lucius, who was wearing a thin brown shirt and leather vest. He seemed to be a wealthy young man, but his sullen attitude and support for the British suggested that he might be hiding something.

Step 3: Analyze the description of the third traveler, Benjamin, who was covered in dust and had long, shaggy hair. He seemed to be a traveler who had been on the road for a while, and his friendly demeanor suggested that he might be an honest person.

Step 4: Analyze the description of the fourth traveler, Jonathan, who had short, yellow hair and red, lined eyes. He seemed to be a young man who was tired and possibly exhausted, and his desire to find work as a sailor suggested that he might be a person who was in a hurry.

Step 5: Look for inconsistencies in the suspects' stories and behavior. Lucius was the only one who seemed to be hiding something, and his support for the British suggested that he might be a traitor.

Step 6: Consider the fact that the British major was described as wearing American clothing and traveling on foot. This suggested that he might be a person who was trying to blend in with the locals.

Step 7: Analyze the behavior of each suspect during the encounter with Nate and the soldiers. Lucius was the only one who seemed to be evasive and hostile, while the other three suspects seemed to be cooperative and friendly.

Step 8: Combine all the evidence and make a final decision. Based on the analysis, Lucius seemed to be the most suspicious person, and his behavior and story seemed to be inconsistent with the others. He was the only one who seemed to be hiding something, and his support for the British suggested that he might be a traitor.

"To analyze the evidence and solve the mystery, I will go through each piece of information provided in the journal entry.

1. The theft of the Robe of the Saints occurred in the ship's hold, where Godefroi was supposed to be watching over it. However, Godefroi reported that his candle had guttered out, and he didn't see who served him his supper. This suggests that the theft might have occurred during the time when Godefroi was not actively watching the chest.

2. Godefroi's supper was placed on the floor of the hold, and he smelled the food, relit his candle, and ate and drank. Shortly afterwards, he fell asleep. This indicates that he might have been drugged, which could have been done by someone who wanted to create an opportunity for the theft.

3. The journal entry mentions that Godefroi gave information about the theft, but it's not clear if he was telling the truth or not. However, it's possible that Godefroi was not involved in the theft, and he might have been trying to deflect suspicion.

4. The journal entry states that everyone on board had an alibi for the time of the theft, except for Captain Fosters, Sir Francis Walters, and Morgan Grant. Captain Fosters claimed that he was in his cabin due to a storm, but the entry does not mention any strong winds or rough seas. This raises some doubts about his alibi.

5. Morgan Grant claimed to have spent the evening in private prayer, but the journal entry does not mention any evidence of his prayers or any other activities that would support his alibi.

6. Sir Francis Walters admitted to getting drunk during the storm, which might seem like a plausible alibi. However, the journal entry mentions that Sir Francis looked at the detective with scorn and had rum on his breath, which suggests that he might have been trying to cover up something.

7. The journal entry mentions a peculiar odor on the mug that the detective detected, which smells like the herb used by the enemy to induce dreams and reduce pain. This could be a clue, but it's not clear if it's relevant to the theft.

8. The journal entry also mentions that the detective had to trace the movements of everyone on board, and nearly everyone had an alibi except for the three suspects. However, the entry does not mention any evidence that would directly implicate one of the suspects.

After analyzing the evidence, I will make an educated guess based on the available information.

Based on the fact that Sir Francis Walters had rum on his breath and seemed to be trying to cover up something, combined with the fact that he was one of the three people without an alibi, I believe that Sir Francis Walters is the most likely suspect.

"To analyze the evidence and determine the guilty party, let's break down the information provided:

1.  Gary's story states that Great Grandfather Tom Patrick and his three cellmates (Billy Calhoun, Jack Trueblood, and Patrick Culpepper) were playing poker for food, as they were only given enough rations for one man.
2.  The guard, Corporal Brubaker, was found dead in the cell with a small puncture wound in his temple, a rusty nail with blood on it, and a small cut on his neck and a bruise on his right knuckle.
3.  During the interrogation, McCool found a small cube of rancid pork in Tom's pocket, but nothing incriminating on his person or clothing.
4.  Billy Calhoun had a bruise on his left bicep and dirt in his pockets with an odd consistency, but no other incriminating evidence.
5.  Jack Trueblood had a cornhusk in his pocket and a dirty, dog-eared diary with no signs of malice or guilt.
6.  Patrick Culpepper had no incriminating evidence, but initially, he seemed cocky and later broke down, confessing to not seeing the corporal's motion due to being practically blind without his glasses.
7.  The tattered bag with remnants of salt was found in the cell, and a small amount of salt was found in Brubaker's pockets.
8.  The key piece of evidence is the discovery of a small puncture wound in Brubaker's temple, a rusty nail with blood on it, and a small cut on his neck and a bruise on his right knuckle.

Analyzing the evidence:

*   The presence of a small puncture wound and a rusty nail with blood on it indicates that the murder was committed with a sharp object, likely a nail.
*   The fact that Brubaker had a small cut on his neck and a bruise on his right knuckle suggests a physical altercation.
*   The presence of a small amount of salt in Brubaker's pockets and a tattered bag with remnants of salt in the cell could be a red herring, but it's also possible that the killer used salt to cover their tracks or to create a diversion.
*   Billy Calhoun's bruise on his left bicep and the odd consistency of the dirt in his pockets could suggest that he was involved in a physical altercation, but it's not conclusive evidence.
*   Jack Trueblood's diary and cornhusk in his pocket suggest that he was a sensitive and thoughtful person, but there's no indication of malice or guilt.
*   Patrick Culpepper's initial cockiness and later confession about not seeing the corporal's motion due to being practically blind without his glasses seem like an attempt to deflect suspicion.

Based on the evidence, the most plausible explanation is that Patrick Culpepper is the guilty party. Here's the reasoning:

*   Culpepper's initial cockiness and later confession about not seeing the corporal's motion due to being practically blind without his glasses seem like an attempt to deflect suspicion. This behavior is inconsistent with the other three suspects, who were all nervous and cooperative during the interrogation.
*   The presence of a small puncture wound and a rusty nail with blood on it in the cell suggests that the murder was committed with a sharp object, likely a nail. Culpepper's behavior and the fact that he was the last to be inspected by McCool suggest that he may have had the opportunity to plant the nail and create a diversion.
*   The discovery of the tattered bag with remnants of salt in the cell and the small amount of salt in Brubaker's pockets could be a red herring, but it's also possible that the killer used salt to cover their tracks or to create a diversion. Culpepper's behavior and the fact that he was the last to be inspected by McCool suggest that he may have had the opportunity to plant the salt and create a diversion.

In conclusion, the most plausible explanation is that Patrick Culpepper is the guilty party. His behavior and the evidence in the cell suggest that he may have committed the crime and attempted to deflect suspicion by confessing to not seeing the corporal's motion due to being practically blind without his glasses.

"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence carefully.

1.  The Bigfoot monster was made to be very convincing, with a fur coat, a scary mask, and a framework to hold it up. This suggests that the person who created it was skilled and had a good understanding of how to make a convincing prop.
2.  The fact that the tape recorder was used to create the sounds of a monster snarling and branches breaking suggests that the person who created the monster was familiar with audio equipment and how to use it to create a convincing sound effect.
3.  The fact that the monster was hidden in a location where it could be easily seen and triggered by the flashbulb suggests that the person who created it wanted to create a dramatic effect and was willing to go to some effort to achieve it.
4.  The fact that the ground was not disturbed near the monster suggests that the person who created it was able to lift it into position and place it without leaving any signs of disturbance.
5.  The fact that the first 30 minutes of the tape were blank suggests that the person who created the monster was able to set up the equipment and record the sounds without anyone noticing.
6.  The fact that the person who created the monster was able to carry it (or at least, the lightweight framework) suggests that they were physically capable of doing so.

Now, let's look at the suspects:

- Burt: Burt is described as a friend of Jerry's, and he's the one who told the story about Bigfoot. However, there's no indication that Burt is particularly skilled with audio equipment or that he's the kind of person who would go to such lengths to create a convincing prop.
- Jerry: Jerry is described as the school's best athlete, and he's the one who suggested taking a picture of the Bigfoot monster to make money. However, there's no indication that Jerry is particularly skilled with audio equipment or that he's the kind of person who would go to such lengths to create a convincing prop.
- Leng: Leng is a foreign exchange student who's new to camping. While he's eager to fit in and have fun, there's no indication that he's particularly skilled with audio equipment or that he's the kind of person who would go to such lengths to create a convincing prop.
- Winston: Winston is described as a shy kid who's not a popular athlete like Jerry. However, there's a detail that suggests he might be more involved in the prank than the others: when the camera is shone on the monster, Winston is the one who says, ""It's stuffed."" This suggests that he might have had some prior knowledge of the monster's construction.

Considering these points, I believe that Winston is the most likely suspect. He's the one who seemed to be the most aware of the monster's construction, and he was able to guess that it was stuffed. Additionally, he's described as being shy and not as popular as Jerry, which suggests that he might have felt the need to prove himself or fit in by coming up with a creative and elaborate prank.

"To analyze the evidence and solve the mystery, let's break down the key points:

1.  Kasey's money was stolen from her purse at some point during the evening. 
2.  The girls all held Kasey's purse at different times: Tammy, Juliet, and then Billy.
3.  Billy claims that he didn't take Kasey's money and that his mom gave him a ten-dollar bill.
4.  Juliet had an opportunity to take Kasey's money when she held the purse, but she had only a five and two ones when asked to show her money.
5.  Tammy also had an opportunity to take Kasey's money when she held the purse, but she had seven singles.
6.  Kasey's money was missing four dollars, which is a significant amount of money.
7.  Juliet surprisingly declares that she knows who took Kasey's money and wants to reveal the information, but Kasey doesn't get to hear it.

Considering these points, we can start to analyze the evidence. Juliet's sudden change in behavior and her willingness to reveal the information without being directly accused suggests that she might be hiding something. Her statement that she knows who took Kasey's money implies that she might be the culprit.

However, we must also consider other suspects. Billy's alibi seems plausible, but he had an opportunity to take the money when he held the purse. Tammy had an opportunity as well, but she had only seven singles when asked to show her money, which seems unlikely if she had taken four dollars.

Given the available evidence, the most likely explanation is that Juliet is the culprit. Her sudden change in behavior and her willingness to reveal the information without being directly accused suggests that she might be hiding something. Additionally, the fact that she had only a five and two ones when asked to show her money, which is not enough to buy a ticket, raises suspicions.

"Analysis:

1.  The mystery begins with Abigail's father telling her about the secret location of the ammunition and asking her to keep it safe. This implies that the person who took the ammunition was not Abigail's father, as he is no longer alive.

2.  The only people who knew about the ammunition's location, besides Abigail, are Mr. Samuel and the soldier. However, Mr. Samuel visited Abigail and her mother that day, and Abigail checked the supply earlier that morning, so it's unlikely that Mr. Samuel took the ammunition.

3.  The soldier, who was sent with a message for Abigail's father, was attacked and his message stolen. This implies that the soldier was trying to prevent the theft of the ammunition, which suggests that he is not the thief.

4.  Abigail had checked the supply earlier that morning and would have noticed if it was missing. The soldier, however, was unconscious, and Abigail did not check the supply after he woke up, which raises the possibility that the theft occurred after Abigail checked the supply.

5.  The only person who could have taken the ammunition without Abigail noticing is Henry, the drunk and former locksmith. Abigail mentions that Henry had been busy fixing things around the house and hall, which would have given him the opportunity to sneak up to the tower and steal the ammunition.

6.  Henry's past behavior as a locksmith and his connection to the locksmith shop owned by Mr. Smith, a Tory, suggests that he might have had a motive to take the ammunition. However, it's more likely that Henry took the ammunition to sell it to the British or to the Tories in the town.

7.  Considering the evidence, the most plausible explanation is that Henry, the drunk, took the ammunition. He had the opportunity, the motive, and the means to steal the ammunition.

"To solve this mystery, I'll analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The bank robbery occurred at 1:00 p.m. The police chief mentioned that the robbers were wearing black ski masks, black gloves, and cheap black sweaters. The witnesses couldn't provide a description, but one of the robbers had a British accent and was described as charming.
2.  The getaway car was spotted on State Route 17, and the police chased it, eventually pinning it down in a muddy field. Only one person was in the car when the police stopped it, a Caucasian male with a British accent.
3.  The police radio conversation indicates that the second robber escaped on foot within the two-mile area surrounding the highway, which includes a small park.
4.  At the park, the police are questioning several suspects, including a motorcyclist, a family man, a bug collector, and an elderly man.
5.  The motorcyclist is wearing a flaming skull on his jacket, which doesn't seem related to the bank robbery.
6.  The family man has an alibi, as his wife and child were with him in the park at the time of the robbery.
7.  The bug collector seems unlikely to be involved, as he's collecting bugs for a science project.
8.  The elderly man claims he was exercising, which is a plausible alibi, but the police are still questioning him.
9.  Now, let's look at the evidence from the hot air balloon scene. The narrator and Uncle Jerry are floating above the park at the time of the robbery, and they see a group of police officers questioning the motorcyclist, the family man, the bug collector, and the elderly man.
10.  Uncle Jerry, the narrator's uncle, claims to have already figured out who robbed the bank, but he doesn't reveal the answer.

Considering the evidence, I'll look for any inconsistencies or clues that might point to one of the suspects. The key to solving this mystery lies in the getaway car scene. The police radio conversation mentions that the second robber escaped on foot within the two-mile area surrounding the highway, which includes the park where the police are questioning the suspects.

Given the details, I notice that Uncle Jerry is floating above the park in a hot air balloon at the time of the robbery. He's watching the police questioning the suspects below and claims to have already figured out who robbed the bank. This implies that Uncle Jerry might be more involved than initially thought.

Looking at the suspects again, I realize that Uncle Jerry is actually ""Eagle,"" the code name used by the ranger station to communicate with him. This means that Uncle Jerry is the one who was communicating with the police station while they were chasing the getaway car.

The final clue comes from the police radio conversation, where they mention that the second robber escaped on foot. However, Uncle Jerry was floating above the park at the time of the robbery and could have easily seen the second robber escaping. This suggests that Uncle Jerry might be the one who escaped on foot.

Putting all the pieces together, I conclude that Uncle Jerry, who was using the code name ""Eagle,"" is the one who robbed the bank. He was the one who escaped on foot, and the police were chasing his hot air balloon, which was the getaway vehicle.

GUILTY: Uncle Jerry",Uncle Jerry,Bug collector,41
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The first clue is that the signpost was turned around, indicating the presence of a German spy. German agents in American uniforms were driving captured jeeps behind the American lines, causing confusion and chaos. The spy had spent time in America as a child and spoke fluent English with no foreign accent.
2.  When the captain and his driver arrive at the abandoned jeep, they find German papers inside. This indicates that the spy must have been in the jeep, but since the engine is cold, he must have gotten out on foot. The captain notices footprints leading down the road in the same direction they are heading.
3.  The captain and his driver rush back to headquarters, where they find that four stragglers have arrived: Anderson, Dilworth, Maguire, and Siegel. The captain orders Sergeant Polonski to round up the extra sentries and get down to the shed where the stragglers are being held.
4.  Inside the shed, the captain notices that five candles in the window are lit, one by one. When asked, Siegel claims he lit the candles for a festival of lights.
5.  The captain then asks each of the stragglers about their background and favorite baseball player. Siegel is from the Bronx and likes Joltin' Joe DiMaggio, Anderson is from Missouri and a St. Louis Cardinals fan, and Dilworth is also from the Bronx and a fan of Babe Ruth. Maguire is from Boston and likes Ted Williams.
6.  The captain then makes his accusation, but the text does not specify who he points to.

Now, let's analyze the clues more closely. The key to this mystery lies in the fact that Siegel, Anderson, Dilworth, and Maguire all have unique backgrounds and favorite baseball players that they could not possibly have known about unless they had spent time in America as children. However, Siegel's mention of Joltin' Joe DiMaggio is suspicious because DiMaggio was an American baseball player, and it would be unusual for a German spy to know about him unless they had spent time in America as a child. However, the other three men also have American backgrounds, but none of them mention a favorite baseball player who was a German or European player.

However, the key clue is in the fact that the captain has been analyzing the stragglers' backgrounds and favorite baseball players. He seems to be looking for a pattern or inconsistency in their stories. The captain's final decision to arrest someone is based on his analysis of the evidence.

Since the text doesn't explicitly state who the captain points to, we need to make an educated guess based on the information provided. The most suspicious person is Siegel, but the captain does not explicitly point to him. However, the captain's analysis of the stragglers' backgrounds and favorite baseball players suggests that he is looking for a person who has a suspicious or inconsistent story.

Given the captain's behavior and the analysis of the evidence, the most likely person the captain points to is...

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and follow the instructions.

1. Analyze the evidence:

- Captain Prescott's coat was missing a button when he checked it after he woke up, but it was not missing when he left it in the room. This suggests that someone entered the room and removed the button while he was sleeping.
- The button was not removed when Mrs. Murray mended the coat, as she would have noticed the missing button and sewn on a new one.
- Mrs. Murray said she mended the coat and hung it up by the front door, but she did not mention removing any buttons.
- Mr. Murray said he saw all the buttons when he checked the coat, but he was in the back, keeping the books, during the time the button could have been removed.
- Ian said he helped Mr. Murray with the barrel of ale and then went back to the horses, but he did not mention entering the room where Captain Prescott's coat was.
- George Sanders said he arrived a few minutes before Captain Prescott came down the stairs, but he was already sitting by the fire when the captain demanded to know who had stolen the button.

2. Explain the reasoning step by step:

- First, we can eliminate George Sanders as a suspect because he was already by the fire when the captain asked who had stolen the button, and he had no opportunity to enter the room.
- Next, we can eliminate Ian because he said he went back to the horses after helping Mr. Murray with the barrel of ale, and he did not mention entering the room.
- We can also eliminate Mr. Murray because he was keeping the books in the back during the time the button could have been removed, and he did not have the opportunity to enter the room.
- This leaves us with Mrs. Murray as the only suspect who had the opportunity to enter the room and remove the button.
- However, Mrs. Murray said she was sweeping the floor while Ian and Mr. Murray were moving the ale, which suggests that she did not have time to enter the room and remove the button during that time.
- But, if we look closely at Mrs. Murray's alibi, we can see that she said she was sweeping the floor ""then"" she went to make the cornbread. This implies that she was sweeping the floor at some point, but it does not necessarily mean she was sweeping the floor at the exact time the button was removed.
- The key to solving this mystery is to realize that Mrs. Murray's alibi is not airtight. She could have been sweeping the floor at some point, but she could have also entered the room and removed the button while she was sweeping.
- The only person who had a clear opportunity to enter the room and remove the button was Mrs. Murray, and her alibi is not strong enough to rule her out.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  **Initial Information**: The story begins with Gabby, an old man, who witnesses a robber on horseback fleeing the scene after a train robbery. The robber had tied a rope near the side of the passenger car and jumped over the edge to get inside. The thief was described as wearing a red bandana, and his horse was waiting for him near the tracks.

2.  **Additional Evidence**: The investigation reveals that the thief's horse was left abandoned near the tracks, and the thief had apparently escaped into the woods. The passengers describe the thief as being around 7 feet tall, which seems suspiciously tall for a normal human.

3.  **Investigation at the Depot**: The sheriff finds the horse tied to a tall aspen tree near the tracks, which suggests the thief had planned this robbery carefully. The sheriff also notices that the train had been traveling from Denver for nearly 300 miles, which implies the thief must have known the train's schedule and route.

4.  **The Crowd's Suspicion**: The crowd at the depot starts suspecting the engineer, the mechanic, and Alvarado, the famous train robber. However, the sheriff is cautious and doesn't immediately jump to conclusions.

5.  **New Clue**: The reporter mentions that Alvarado rode into town this afternoon, giving him plenty of time to set up the robbery. However, the sheriff arrests Alvarado on the spot, stating that he's innocent until proven guilty.

6.  **Gabby's Revelation**: Gabby, the old man who witnessed the robbery, reveals that he knows the truth. He claims he sat right next to the robber as he rode past him on his horse. Gabby then says, ""And after listening to you folks talk, I've figured out who was on that horse.""

7.  **Analysis**: The key to solving this mystery lies in understanding the events that occurred after the robbery. The sheriff's actions and Gabby's revelation are crucial. The sheriff arrested Alvarado, the famous train robber, but then released him, implying that he wasn't the culprit. This suggests that the real thief was still at large.

8.  **Gabby's Motivation**: Gabby's sudden revelation and claim that he knows the truth is suspicious. He was the one who initially pointed out the direction of the robber's escape. Gabby's statement that he ""sat right here as he rode his horse on past me"" implies that he was present at the scene of the crime and had a close encounter with the thief.

9.  **The Mechanic's Suspicious Behavior**: The mechanic was described as being a little uncomfortable around strangers due to his birthmark on his forehead. This made him a potential target for suspicion. However, his fear of being stared at by strangers is a red herring.

10. **The Final Clue**: The key to solving this mystery lies in understanding the events that occurred after the robbery. The sheriff's actions and Gabby's revelation are crucial. The sheriff arrested Alvarado, the famous train robber, but then released him, implying that he wasn't the culprit. This suggests that the real thief was still at large.

Considering all the evidence, the most plausible explanation is that Gabby was the one who committed the robbery. Here's why:

-   Gabby was the one who initially pointed out the direction of the robber's escape, which implies he was present at the scene of the crime.
-   He was the one who sat next to the robber as he rode past him on his horse, suggesting that Gabby had a close encounter with the thief.
-   The sheriff arrested Alvarado, the famous train robber, but then released him, implying that he wasn't the culprit. This suggests that the real thief was still at large.
-   The mechanic's suspicious behavior is a red herring, and the engineer's alibi checks out.
-   Alvarado's presence in town is a coincidence, and the sheriff's actions suggest that he's not the culprit.

1.  The safe was opened between 5:00 pm and 7:00 pm, as indicated by the erased security video.
2.  Bob's alibi checks out. He was in Japan from Friday to Saturday and returned on the redeye flight, which would have put him in Boulder at 7:25 pm on Saturday. He was in a cab on the way home when he received the call to come to the office, which aligns with his story.
3.  Diane's alibi checks out as well. She had dinner and a movie with her husband before dropping him off at work at 9:00 pm, and then she went to the office to pick up the weekly reports.
4.  Kristin's alibi also checks out. She taught a yoga class from 5:00 to 7:00 pm, which provides a solid alibi for the time the safe was opened.
5.  Cynthia's alibi for the time the safe was opened is suspicious. She said she was home alone from 5:00 pm on, but the security footage shows her arriving at the office at 4:45 pm and not leaving until 5:00 pm. This creates a window of opportunity for her to open the safe.
6.  Cynthia's excuse for being at the office is also suspicious. She said she was there to pick up some skin cream, but it's unlikely that she would need to enter the office to do so, especially since the company is open 24/7.
7.  Additionally, Cynthia's comment, ""There must be another employee who had access to the security tapes because I did not do it,"" seems like a red flag. It's an attempt to deflect suspicion and implies that she knows something about the erased security footage.

Based on the evidence, the most likely suspect is Cynthia. Her alibi for the time the safe was opened is suspicious, and her excuse for being at the office is unconvincing. Her comment about the security tapes also raises suspicions.

"To determine the killer, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The time of death is estimated to be around 8:00 AM. 

2.  Clifford Lang was found dead in his trailer, and the medical examiner confirmed that poison entered his system just before 8:00 AM. This implies that the murder occurred between 7:30 AM and 8:00 AM.

3.  Sal, the director, claimed to have found Clifford's body at around 8:00 AM and didn't touch him. However, he did use his master key to enter the trailer.

4.  Angela, the leading lady, claimed to have been sitting in a chair outside the house at 8:00 AM, but she could be lying. However, Sal, who would have been in a position to see her, corroborated her alibi.

5.  Tom, the cameraman, said he was taking a walk in the park across the road from 7:30 AM to 8:00 AM to clear his head. However, he also mentioned that he had to set up his camera equipment before 8:00 AM.

6.  Debbie, the director's assistant, claimed to have left Clifford's trailer after giving him coffee at 8:00 AM. She also mentioned that she had to get Sal some herbs from the health food store on Tuesday and Angela some Dragon Fruit yesterday, which was a delicacy that could potentially be used to help control blood sugar.

7.  Angela claimed that she and Clifford were in a romantic relationship and that she had been trying to help him control his diabetes by giving him healthy food. However, this could be a motive for the murder if Clifford's weight gain was a problem.

8.  Tom had a motive to kill Clifford due to their past conflicts on set, but he seemed genuinely upset about Clifford's behavior.

9.  Sal's alibi for the time of the murder is shaky at best, and his nervous behavior around the investigation suggests that he might be hiding something.

10.  Debbie's story about getting herbs and fruit for the cast members seems suspicious, as she seemed to be trying to impress the detective with her ""smart"" behavior and connections in the industry.

Given these points, let's evaluate the suspects:

- Angela's alibi is corroborated by Sal, and her motive is somewhat mitigated by her claim of a romantic relationship with Clifford.
- Tom's alibi is shaky, and his motive is strong, but his behavior seems genuine.
- Sal's alibi is shaky, and his nervous behavior suggests that he might be hiding something.
- Debbie's alibi is suspicious, and her behavior seems overly rehearsed, suggesting that she might be hiding something.

Based on the analysis, the most suspicious person is Debbie, the director's assistant. She seemed overly rehearsed and had access to the herbs and fruit that could have been used to kill Clifford. Her motive for the murder could be that she wanted to eliminate Clifford to gain favor with the director and advance her own acting career.

2.  John Plympton had planned to leave the baseball to me, Richard Harding Davis, but he did not put it in writing.
3.  After John Plympton's death, the baseball went missing. Simon Plympton and his wife Susan claimed they had not noticed it, but Susan became interested in the baseball when I shared the full story of its significance.
4.  Simon Plympton had taken a last look at the room after John Plympton's death, but he couldn't remember if the baseball was still there.
5.  Melinda Baker, the nurse, claimed she didn't pay attention to our conversation about the baseball, but it's unlikely that she wouldn't remember something as significant as John Plympton's will.
6.  Dr. Edgar Newton, the physician, conducted a perfunctory examination and didn't seem to be interested in the baseball.
7.  However, the person who pawned the baseball received $5,000, a relatively small amount considering its value, suggesting they might be in a financial bind.
8.  Considering the above points, let's analyze the motives and alibis of the suspects:

*   Dr. Edgar Newton: There is no evidence to suggest that Dr. Newton had any motive to steal the baseball. He conducted a perfunctory examination and didn't seem interested in the baseball.
*   Melinda Baker: Melinda claimed she didn't pay attention to our conversation about the baseball, but it's unlikely that she wouldn't remember something as significant as John Plympton's will. However, she might have had an opportunity to steal the baseball when she was plumping the old man's pillows and hovering near the wardrobe.
*   Simon Plympton: Simon had a motive to steal the baseball since he stood to gain a significant amount of money from his grandfather's estate. He also had an opportunity to steal the baseball when he took a last look at the room after John Plympton's death.
*   Susan Plympton: Susan had a motive to steal the baseball since she and her husband would gain the house and furnishings from John Plympton's estate. However, she didn't seem very interested in the baseball until I shared the full story of its significance.

Considering the motives and alibis of the suspects, Simon Plympton had the most significant motive and opportunity to steal the baseball. The fact that he couldn't remember whether the baseball was still there after John Plympton's death suggests that he might have been trying to cover his tracks.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. Karen noticed that Cole stayed focused on the evergreen shrubbery in the middle of the field, finding several eggs there. This suggests that Cole didn't move around much during the hunt.

2. Rachel ran to her mother and told her, ""I have found a lot of eggs. I'm heading back to the rock pile. I bet I will find the golden egg there!"" This indicates that Rachel did move from the area where she was initially searching to the rock pile, which is on the opposite side of the field.

3. Karen excused herself to go inside the church to get a drink of water and sit for a few minutes. During this time, Karla warned Lizzie to be careful of the dead branches on the big oak tree. This is a crucial piece of information, as it implies that Lizzie was near the oak tree at some point.

4. After Karen returned from her break, Karla walked out to speak with an agitated Anna. This suggests that Anna was also in a different area of the field at some point.

5. Karen noticed that Anna stayed close to Karla for the remainder of the hunt. This implies that Anna was not moving around much during the rest of the hunt.

6. Justin was in the far right corner of the field, where he had been for the entire hunt. This suggests that Justin didn't move from this area either.

7. When Karen asked if any of the children moved from one side of the field to another during her first break, Karla answered, ""No."" This is an important clue, as it implies that Karen is relying on this information to make her deduction.

Given these points, we can deduce that Rachel is the only child who moved from one side of the field to another. Since Karen knew that the golden egg was placed in the area dedicated to the 6-10 year old age group, which is near the big oak tree, and Rachel was the only one who moved to the rock pile (which is near the oak tree), it's likely that Rachel found the golden egg.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Mary finds a thousand rabbits in the meadow**: This is an interesting starting point. The sheer number of rabbits implies that they were all involved in hiding the eggs. However, it also suggests that they were trying to hide their tracks.

2. **Abbot is introduced as the smartest bunny and the one who teaches the others about hiding eggs**: This implies that Abbot is the leader or at least one of the key players in the egg-hiding game.

3. **Randy makes a joke about Abbot being lazy, but Abbot tries to preach about the importance of hiding eggs carefully**: This suggests a rivalry or at least a disagreement between Abbot and Randy.

4. **Speedy is introduced as the fastest bunny and is able to roll the eggs out of sight with a single yell**: This shows that Speedy has a unique skillset and is able to perform impressive feats.

5. **Randy's twin brother, Andy, is introduced, and the two of them are able to reappear and help Speedy find the hidden eggs**: This implies that the twins are capable of teamwork and quick thinking.

6. **Mary asks for a souvenir, and Abbot gives her flowers, while Randy gives her an Easter egg**: This shows that Randy is willing to give Mary a gift, but Abbot is not.

7. **Mary finds a blue and yellow egg in her pocket after she leaves the meadow**: This is the most crucial piece of evidence. The fact that Mary finds an egg in her pocket after she leaves the meadow implies that one of the bunnies snuck it into her pocket before she left.

Now, let's analyze the behavior of each suspect:

* Abbot: Abbot is the leader and is focused on teaching the others about hiding eggs. While he does give Mary flowers, he doesn't give her an egg, which suggests that he might not be the one who snuck the egg into her pocket.
* Andy: Andy is introduced as Randy's twin brother, and the two of them work together to help Speedy find the hidden eggs. There is no direct evidence to implicate Andy in the act of sneaking the egg into Mary's pocket.
* Randy: Randy is willing to give Mary an Easter egg as a souvenir, which suggests that he might be the one who snuck the egg into her pocket. Additionally, Randy's behavior is consistent with the idea that he is a bit mischievous and likes to play pranks.
* Speedy: Speedy is able to roll the eggs out of sight with a single yell, but there is no direct evidence to implicate him in the act of sneaking the egg into Mary's pocket.

Based on the evidence, I believe that Randy is the most likely culprit. His willingness to give Mary an Easter egg as a souvenir, combined with his mischievous behavior, makes him the most suspicious. Additionally, the fact that he and his twin brother Andy are able to work together to help Speedy find the hidden eggs suggests that they might be more willing to work together on a prank.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  **Barney's Location**: Barney was able to see through a small hole in the boxcar, which allowed him to observe his surroundings. He saw a park with a statue and a biking trail. This information is crucial in determining his location.

2.  **Statue**: Barney saw a statue of someone, but unfortunately, he couldn't identify who it was. However, the fact that he saw a statue suggests that he was in a public area with landmarks.

3.  **Biking Trail**: Barney saw a biking trail, which indicates that he was in a region with bike-friendly infrastructure. This is a common feature in many cities and towns, but it doesn't narrow down the location too much.

4.  **Scenery**: Barney observed that the scenery on the right side of the train had more greenery and was more pleasant to look at. This could be due to the presence of parks or gardens in the area.

5.  **Juggling Balls**: Barney's juggling balls were placed at the front of the boxcar, which suggests that Fred (his friend) intentionally left them there to help Barney solve the mystery.

6.  **Time and Distance**: Barney knew that he was on a train that left New York City at 3:00 am and would arrive at its destination at 10:00 am. The distances between the potential destinations were given: Philadelphia, PA (94 miles), Boston, MA (216 miles), Washington, DC (229 miles), Pittsburgh, PA (339 miles), and Raleigh, NC (511 miles).

Considering these clues, let's examine the options:

- **Boston, MA**: Boston is a city with a rich history and many parks. It's possible that Barney saw a statue in a park in Boston. However, the distance from New York City to Boston is 216 miles, which would take around 3.5 hours by train. Given that the train arrived at its destination at 10:00 am, this seems like a plausible option.

- **Philadelphia, PA**: Philadelphia is another city with many parks and landmarks. However, the distance from New York City to Philadelphia is 94 miles, which would take around 1.5 hours by train. This seems too short for a train ride that started at 3:00 am and arrived at 10:00 am.

- **Washington, DC**: Washington, DC is a city with many parks and landmarks, but it's also a bit farther from New York City (229 miles). This option seems possible, but the distance is still shorter than Boston.

- **Pittsburgh, PA**: Pittsburgh is a city with many parks and a scenic landscape, which matches Barney's observation of more greenery on the right side of the train. However, the distance from New York City to Pittsburgh is 339 miles, which would take around 5.5 hours by train. This seems like a plausible option.

- **Raleigh, NC**: Raleigh is a city in North Carolina with many parks and a bike-friendly infrastructure. However, the distance from New York City to Raleigh is 511 miles, which would take around 7.5 hours by train. This seems like a less likely option given the time constraint.

Given the time constraint and the fact that Barney saw a biking trail and a park, I believe the most likely location is **Pittsburgh, PA**. The distance from New York City to Pittsburgh is 339 miles, which would take around 5.5 hours by train, leaving enough time for the train to arrive at its destination by 10:00 am. The scenic landscape with more greenery on the right side of the train also matches Pittsburgh's landscape.

"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The food coloring was left on the kitchen counter, and the green gloves were on top of the trash bags in the garbage can. This suggests that the person who left the food coloring and the gloves did not clean up after themselves.
2.  The green gloves were on top of the trash bags, which were put in the garbage can by Carm. This implies that Carm was the one who put the gloves there, and she was also the one who cleaned up after the baby shower.
3.  However, if Carm had put the gloves on the trash bags, she would have had green hands, which Margie checked and didn't find.
4.  The person who wrote ""What color are my feet?"" on Margie's face must have used the red ink from the kitchen, as there was no other source mentioned. Since the person who left the food coloring was also the one who used the red ink, it's likely that this person is also the one who wrote on Margie's face.
5.  The fact that the green gloves were on top of the trash bags and the person who cleaned up after the baby shower is likely the same person suggests that this person is also the one who bagged the trash.
6.  The only person who didn't come straight to Yours Truly from Margie's house was Maureen, but she mentioned that she drove her mom back home first, which doesn't necessarily mean she didn't bag the trash.
7.  The fact that Jen has an allergy to latex and didn't have any green hands suggests that she is unlikely to be the one who handled the green gloves.
8.  Diane suggested the fingernail polish remover, club soda, and finally the rubbing alcohol to remove the writing from Margie's face, which implies that she was involved in the prank.
9.  However, the fact that Diane was the one who found the rubbing alcohol in her purse and suggested its use to remove the writing from Margie's face doesn't necessarily mean she was the one who wrote it.

Considering all these points, the most likely person who is guilty is Diane. She was involved in the prank (suggested the methods to remove the writing), and the fact that she was the one who found the rubbing alcohol in her purse implies that she might have been the one who used it to write on Margie's face. Additionally, she was the one who put the gloves on top of the trash bags, which were bagged by the person who cleaned up after the baby shower.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence provided by Uncle Robert.

1. The spy's description matches Uncle Robert's physical appearance, which means that Uncle Robert is impersonating the spy. However, the spy's wallet only contains a bus ticket, a locker key, and a charity card, which does not provide any information about the spy's preferences or habits.

2. The spy wants to receive a microchip concealed in a dish ordered from the menu. The microchip is hidden in a dish ordered from the menu, and the contact is one of the chefs. The dish must be ordered by the spy, and it must be a dish that the contact can easily prepare.

3. The contact is one of the four chefs: Gianni Girodano, Atsushi Nishi, Jean-Pierre Dubois, or Jack McDonald. The contact must be able to communicate with the spy without arousing suspicion, so it's likely that the contact is the chef who is working the dinner session that the spy is likely to attend.

4. The waiter recommends the French onion soup, which is a popular dish that is being prepared by Jean-Pierre Dubois. However, the waiter also mentions that the French onion soup is being made in a session that started at lunchtime and is still being served in the evening. This means that Jean-Pierre Dubois has been working for at least 6 hours, which is unusual for a chef.

5. The waiter also mentions that Atsushi Nishi is on a world tour and has cooked in six restaurants today, which is highly unlikely for a chef who is supposed to be working at Foie Paux in the evening.

6. Gianni Girodano is the only chef who is not mentioned as being unusual in any way. He is making Italian lasagna and is flirting with customers, but this does not provide any evidence of his guilt.

7. Jack McDonald is the only chef who is making a dish that is not being served in a blue dish (the spy's preferred dish). The spy is likely to order a dish in a blue dish, which means that Jack McDonald is unlikely to be the contact.

Considering these points, I conclude that the contact chef who is working with the spy is Jean-Pierre Dubois, as he is the only chef who has been working for an unusually long time and has a plausible reason for being the contact.

GUILTY: Jean-Pierre Dubois",Jean-Pierre Dubois,Gianni Girodano,52
"To determine the guilty person, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **The scene of the crime**: The casket is found open, and the necklace is missing. The only clue is white powder (likely gunpowder) on the floor and scuffed boot prints near the casket.

2. **Timing**: The theft occurred between 2 hours ago, when Captain Roberts last saw the casket, and now. This gives us a narrow time frame to consider.

3. **Suspect statements**:
   - **Mr. Arbuthnot**: Claims to have checked for structural damage but had the tools and skills to break the casket. However, he seemed confident and unafraid, which might not be typical of a thief.
   - **Will**: Claims to have been searching for new shirts for Captain Roberts but left the cabin immediately after being startled by the captain. He also claims to have been with Captain Roberts on the Ranger.
   - **Nehemiah**: Unable to speak due to his tongue being cut out, so we can't rely on verbal statements from him. He mimed bringing a platter, which could be a plausible reason for entering the cabin, but he denied stealing the necklace.
   - **Bosun Ridley**: Claims to have been checking the cabin for charts and instruments for a refit. He seems confident and unafraid, but we don't have any concrete evidence against him.

4. **Key observations**:
   - **Parrot's behavior**: The parrot says ""Pretty necklace"" and ""Pretty Polly"" multiple times, which might indicate it's trying to attract attention to itself or the necklace.
   - **Boot prints**: The scuffed boot prints near the casket could belong to the thief. Since Will was with Captain Roberts on the Ranger, it's unlikely his boots would be on the Jackdaw.
   - **Gunpowder**: The gunpowder on the floor might indicate that the thief was nervous or trying to distract from their tracks. However, it's also possible that the gunpowder came from Will, as Captain Roberts mentioned that Will knocked all that powder on the floor.

5. **Putting the evidence together**: Given the time frame and the presence of the parrot's comments, it's possible that the thief was trying to throw off suspicion by mentioning the necklace and making a commotion. Considering Will's behavior, he seemed genuinely nervous and scared when he entered the cabin. However, he claimed to have been with Captain Roberts on the Ranger, which would explain why his boots weren't on the Jackdaw. 

However, there's a crucial detail that stands out: **Captain Roberts mentioned that he had to drag Will out with him when he left the Jackdaw to go back to the Ranger**. This means Will couldn't have been on the Jackdaw when the theft occurred, and his boots wouldn't have been on the deck.

Given this new information, let's re-examine the evidence:
   - Will's alibi is broken, and he had the opportunity to commit the crime.
   - The parrot's comments about the necklace could be a red herring to distract from the real culprit.
   - The gunpowder could still be a clue, but it's not as significant now that Will's alibi is broken.

Based on this analysis, the most likely culprit is:

GUILTY: Will",Will,Bosun Ridley,53
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. The security breach occurred at 0346 hours, and the SSCU was removed without setting off security alerts. This suggests that the saboteur had knowledge of the station's security systems and protocols.

2. The SSCU was removed, and the inventory log for the 0300 to 0400 period was deleted. This implies that the saboteur had access to the inventory system and the ability to delete logs.

3. The three suspects who had the capability to remove the SSCU without setting off security alerts are Lt. Erikson, Valance, and Bennington. However, Bennington's reputation as a ladies' man and his questionable technical ability make it less likely that he could have removed the SSCU without setting off alarms.

4. Valance has an alibi for the time period in question, having been working on a control shunt in corridor B32 with Bennington. However, he also had a conversation with Scrivine, who is a suspect.

5. O'Hennessey has a history of disciplinary issues, including public brawling and operating a still. He also has a visitor in the brig who seems to know him well, suggesting a possible connection to the saboteur.

6. The discovery of a woman's finger in the garbage disposal suggests that the saboteur may have had an accomplice.

7. The new lighting controllers found in the insulation in B32 are a significant clue. The fact that they were brand new and still sealed in plastic wrap suggests that they were recently installed. This could be a red herring, but it's also possible that the saboteur used these controllers to disable the security cameras in the area.

8. The handprints on Lt. Erikson's uniform are a crucial clue. The fact that they match Bennington's size and are the color of insulation foam suggests that Bennington may have been in contact with Erikson's uniform, possibly to create a false alibi.

Considering all the evidence, the most likely suspect is:

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and follow the instructions.

1. Analyzing the evidence:

   - The flying saucer was seen by Zach, Larry, Uncle Art, and Dora, which suggests that the incident was real and not just a product of their imagination.
   - The sudden blast of wind, the dust cloud, and the humming noise indicate a deliberate attempt to create a dramatic and convincing effect.
   - The tire tracks found in the sand suggest that the ""flying saucer"" was actually a vehicle that landed and took off from the desert.
   - The TV station's letter, supposedly sent to Uncle Art, is suspicious because it's not on letterhead and is written rather than called.
   - Larry's observation that a TV station would call, not write a letter, about news, is also a crucial point.

2. Explaining the reasoning step by step:

   - Considering the tire tracks, it's clear that the ""flying saucer"" was not a genuine extraterrestrial spacecraft but a vehicle that was brought to the desert and landed.
   - The fact that the ""spaceship"" disappeared into thin air suggests that it was a staged event, and the perpetrators likely had a plan to create a convincing illusion.
   - Given the suspicious nature of the TV station's letter, it's likely that the perpetrator wanted to create a connection between the incident and a media outlet to add credibility to the event.
   - Larry's observation about the letter being written rather than called suggests that the perpetrator is not affiliated with the TV station.
   - The fact that Larry seems to know the truth and is calm and certain about it implies that he may be the one who set up the entire event.

"Analysis:

1. The musket was last seen by the door, and the suspect who left the house for milking at 3 a.m. is Stevie Brown. This means Stevie is the last person to have seen the musket before it went missing.
2. The musket went missing before the sun had risen, and it was only noticed after the sun had risen. This implies that the thief was likely someone who was already outside before the sun rose.
3. Stevie Brown left the house at 3 a.m. for milking, which means he was outside before the sun rose. He was also the one who mentioned that the musket was by the door when he left for milking, which suggests that he didn't take the musket.
4. Lyle Day and Mary Wright were both asleep when Stevie left for milking, so they couldn't have taken the musket.
5. Paul Revere rode past the house at 4 a.m. and shouted his warning to the narrator, but there is no indication that he was in the area before that time. Since the musket went missing before the sun rose, it's unlikely that Revere took the musket.
6. The key clue is the rain that started after Stevie left for milking. The narrator mentions that the rain made the cows muddy, which suggests that Stevie was outside in the rain. If Stevie was outside in the rain, it's likely that he took the musket with him to keep it dry.

"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  Siobhan's initial investigation at the MacDonald household reveals that the piñata was taken between 4:30 - 6:00 a.m. The fact that the piñata was taken during this time frame is crucial, as it will help us narrow down the list of suspects.

2.  Zachary MacDonald is the first suspect to be questioned. He admits to telling his friends, Evan and Richie, about the piñata money. This is a significant detail because it means that these two friends now know about the money in the piñata.

3.  Siobhan then visits the Carpenter household and talks to Evan, who claims to have been walking his dogs at the time of the theft. However, his sister Emily is seen eating chocolate, which suggests she might have had access to the piñata.

4.  Emily is questioned, and she reveals that she received a lot of chocolates as Valentine's Day gifts a month ago, which doesn't directly implicate her in the current case. However, her behavior and the presence of a jar of quarters in her wagon raise suspicions.

5.  Siobhan then visits Richie, who claims to be innocent and shows her his non-stamped ones. However, this doesn't necessarily clear him of suspicion, as he could have obtained the money from another source.

6.  The breakthrough comes when Siobhan searches the change machine at the arcade and finds five shamrock-stamped bills. This is a significant clue, as it suggests that the thief might have exchanged the stolen money for smaller denominations at the arcade.

7.  Analyzing the surveillance footage from the arcade, we see that Emily, the Carpenter's daughter, was at the arcade earlier that day. However, we don't see her exchanging the money for smaller denominations. Instead, the footage shows Richie Harris, the arcade owner's son, exchanging the money at the change machine.

8.  Considering the evidence, it seems that Richie Harris is the most likely culprit. The presence of the shamrock-stamped bills in the change machine, combined with his behavior at the arcade, suggests that he might have stolen the piñata and exchanged the money for smaller denominations.

GUILTY: Richie Harris",Richie Harris,Emily Carpenter,57
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Security Measures**: The store has multiple layers of security, including alarms, cameras, an x-ray scanner, and a dog door with an outside camera. The only person who could potentially bypass these measures is Rufus, but the evidence suggests that he was taken care of by Earl, and there's no indication that he was involved in the theft.

2. **Timeline of Events**: The events of the night of the robbery are as follows:
	* Tom arrives at 6 p.m. and checks on the necklace with Christopher.
	* Tom and Christopher count the money, and Tom locks up the store at 1:30 a.m. when Earl arrives.
	* Earl scans Tom through the x-ray machine and finds nothing.
	* Earl and Tom check on the necklace, and Earl admits that he didn't know if the green necklace he saw was real or fake.
	* Earl makes his rounds and eats breakfast, and then leaves the store when his shift ends.
	* The store is searched, and the police find a fake necklace in its place.
3. **Interviews with Suspects**:
	* Tom's story checks out, and he has an alibi for the time of the robbery.
	* Earl's story also checks out, and he had x-rayed Tom before he left the store.
	* Christopher's story checks out, and he had been busy counting the money and helping Tom with the deposit.
	* Robert's story checks out, and he had been collecting deposits on his route around town.
4. **X-ray Scan**: The x-ray scan of Tom before he left the store shows no sign of the pearls.
5. **Security Video**: The security video from the day after the robbery shows Tom entering the store after Earl and Rufus have left. This is suspicious, as it implies that Tom might have been back at the store after his shift ended.

Considering the evidence, the most suspicious behavior is Tom's entry into the store after his shift ended. This suggests that Tom might have returned to the store to steal the pearls. The fact that the x-ray scan of Tom before he left the store shows no sign of the pearls also implies that Tom might have taken them later.

"To analyze the evidence carefully, let's break it down step by step:

1.  The victim, Nancy, was found dead in her dressing room with a knife in her back. The time of death was determined to be late in the afternoon.
2.  The victim's routine was to spend the entire day in her dressing room, alone, doing yoga and meditating before her show. 
3.  The four suspects were in the dressing area the entire day: Kevin Doyle, the theatre owner; two actresses, Joanne Driscoll and Helen Smith; and a cleaning lady, Sarah Jones. Each of them went in separately and came out less than ten minutes later.
4.  The suspects were all carrying something large enough to hide a knife, which makes them all potential suspects.
5.  The video footage from the hallway outside the dressing rooms shows that each suspect entered the area separately and did not linger.
6.  The coroner found no fingerprints on the scene and no other clues, including a note.
7.  The cleaning lady, Sarah Jones, stated that she only cleaned the dressing rooms when the occupants were not present and that Nancy's dressing room was never cleaned while she was inside.
8.  The actresses, Joanne Driscoll and Helen Smith, claimed to have rehearsed with the rest of the cast and took leftover bagels to the refrigerator in the actress's dressing room. However, this seems suspicious, as they both seemed nervous when questioned about talking to Nancy.

Considering the evidence, it seems that the most suspicious behavior is exhibited by the two actresses, Joanne Driscoll and Helen Smith. They were both in the dressing area the same day as Nancy's murder and seemed nervous when questioned about talking to her. However, the key to solving the case lies in the fact that the actresses took leftover bagels to the refrigerator in the actress's dressing room. This implies that they were in the area more than they initially claimed.

Upon further inspection, the refrigerator in the second dressing room contained bagels, which suggests that someone had access to the refrigerator in Nancy's dressing room. Given that the cleaning lady, Sarah Jones, claimed she never cleaned Nancy's dressing room while Nancy was inside, it is unlikely that the bagels were placed there by her. 

This leaves the two actresses as the most likely suspects, but we must determine which one was the actual killer. Given that both actresses seemed nervous and provided conflicting stories about their actions, it is possible that one of them was trying to cover for the other. However, there is a crucial detail that points to one of the actresses as the killer.

The detail is that the coroner found no fingerprints on the scene, and the killer must have had to touch the knife and possibly other surfaces to commit the crime. Given that the actresses took the bagels to the refrigerator, it is likely that one of them was in Nancy's dressing room and had access to the knife. However, the fact that there are no fingerprints suggests that the killer may have been careful to avoid leaving any fingerprints.

Given these details, it is more likely that Helen Smith was the killer. When questioned, Helen stated that she took the leftover bagels to the refrigerator in the actress's dressing room and that she did not talk to Nancy. However, if Helen was in Nancy's dressing room, she would have had access to the knife and would have had to be careful not to leave any fingerprints. Joanne Driscoll, on the other hand, seemed to be trying to cover for Helen, stating that they were rehearsing and that she did not talk to Nancy. This behavior suggests that Joanne may have been trying to protect Helen, implying that Helen was the one who actually committed the crime.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **Motivation:** The motive for the murder is revealed when it's discovered that Private Glendenning Bryan was hoarding food in his clothing, planning to eat it when he felt better. This means the killer likely acted out of desperation for food.

2. **Physical Ability:** Horner, a 40-year-old man with arthritis in his hands, claims he couldn't hold a knife. This could be a possible alibi, but it's not conclusive. 

3. **Alibis:** 
   - Horner says he was asleep when the murder occurred and didn't see or hear anything unusual.
   - Thornton claims he was outside walking most of the night and only returned to the tent a couple of times, but didn't notice anything unusual about Bryan.
   - Whisenant was sick and spent the night by the sinks, but returned to the tent a few minutes before the conversation began.
   - Crosby was at the other end of the camp, trying to get fresh air.

4. **Circumstantial Evidence:** 
   - The discovery of the knife is not explicitly mentioned, but the narrative implies that the killer might have hidden it or disposed of it.
   - There's no clear evidence of a struggle or any other signs of a violent confrontation.

5. **Psychological Analysis:** 
   - Horner seems defensive and short-tempered, which might indicate guilt. However, this could also be a result of the situation and the harsh conditions of the prison camp.
   - Thornton appears to be calm and composed, which might suggest innocence. However, his alibi relies on not being seen, which is not a strong alibi in a small, confined space like the tent.
   - Whisenant seems genuinely ill and traumatized by the sight of Bryan's body, which could be a genuine reaction. However, this doesn't necessarily rule out guilt.
   - Crosby is in charge and seems to be handling the situation professionally, which might suggest innocence. However, as the senior NCO, he might be trying to maintain order and control.

6. **Final Analysis:** 
   - Considering the evidence and the alibis, I will focus on the statements that seem most suspicious. 
   - Horner's defensive behavior and claim of being asleep might be a weak alibi, but it's not conclusive.
   - Thornton's alibi is also not strong, as he was outside, but not necessarily alone.
   - Whisenant's sickness and genuine reaction to the body are hard to fake, making it harder to suspect him of the crime.
   - Crosby's statement ""I know who killed Bryan"" suggests he has a clear idea of the killer's identity.

Given the above analysis, the statement ""I know who killed Bryan"" from Crosby implies that he has a solid reason to believe one of the suspects is guilty. Since the other suspects seem to have weak alibis or reactions that could be genuine, I will focus on Crosby's statement. Considering the situation and the personalities, it's possible that Crosby is trying to deflect suspicion from himself or is trying to create a distraction.

However, based on the information provided and without any direct evidence pointing to Crosby's guilt, I will consider the possibility that Crosby's statement might be a red herring. Given the options, I will choose the suspect that seems least likely to be guilty based on the analysis.

"To analyze the evidence, I will follow the events described in the story step by step.

1. The film room is located at the end of a hallway that is covered by a 24-hour video camera. The camera records the three monitors simultaneously, including the film room, on an 8-hour tape. Each tape is labeled with the date and time, which comes from the internet, so it cannot be altered.

2. At the beginning of the tape, Chuck Jarrett is seen leaving the film room. This means that Chuck was in the film room at some point before the tape started recording.

3. Carli Antor leaves the film room at 12:43 am. This is the last time anyone is seen on the tape entering or leaving the film room before the tape ends at 7 am.

4. The film is discovered missing at 6:45 am.

Given these points, we can conclude that the film must have been stolen between 12:43 am and 6:45 am. However, the tape only records the events from the start of the shift until 7 am, so we cannot see what happened during this time period.

However, we do know that Tom Barrett was on duty until 7 am and was the last person to guard the hallway before the new guard, Rich Pender, took over. 

The crucial piece of information is that the tape shows Carli leaving the film room at 12:43 am, but it does not show her returning. Since the tape ends at 7 am and the film is discovered missing at 6:45 am, it is possible that Carli returned to the film room after the tape ended and stole the film.

Therefore, the only person who could have stolen the film is Carli Antor.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and explain my reasoning step by step.

1.  **Analysis of the crime scene and circumstances:**
    - The cannon was taken from the dock when it was high tide, making it easier to remove due to the lower water level.
    - The guards had paced the docks all night and saw nothing unusual, but this doesn't necessarily mean they saw everything.
    - The use of block and tackle would have made noise, but there's no mention of any noise being reported by the guards or anyone else.
    - The ship, ""Resolve,"" was not rigged with derricks, which could have been used to lift the cannon.

2.  **Analysis of the suspects:**
    - **Captain Parker:** He was on the ship all night, and the guards didn't see anything unusual. He's a large man, and his presence on the ship might have allowed him to easily hide the cannon. He was also given a break in price for the pig iron, which might be a motive for him to have taken the cannon.
    - **Bob Turkle:** He was on the dock early in the morning, but the guards had already talked to him before the theft was discovered. He's a patriot, but this doesn't necessarily mean he's loyal to the king. He might have been trying to get information about the cannon.
    - **Paul Rhodes:** He's a loyalist and has been heard threatening to sink the Resolve. He's also the only suspect who seemed to be hiding something (he stood up and raised his voice when questioned).
    - **Tom Wise:** He's also a loyalist, but he seemed less confrontational than Rhodes. There's no clear motive for him to take the cannon.

3.  **Analysis of the clue given by Peter:**
    - Peter noticed that the ship was as deep in the water as it was the previous day. This is an important clue because it suggests that the ship didn't have the cannon removed.

4.  **Analysis of the suspects based on the clue:**
    - If the ship was as deep in the water as it was the previous day, it means that the cannon was not removed from the ship. This contradicts the initial statement that the cannon was taken from the dock.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    - The only person who could have taken the cannon without removing it from the ship is the person who was on the ship all night. This person had the opportunity to hide the cannon on the ship without anyone noticing.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the person who took the cannon is:

1. **Prank timing and access**: The prank occurred at 6:00 a.m. when Diane walked out of the cabin. The prankster had to have access to the cabin and the buckets of ice water. Since Diane's campers were with her at that time, they couldn't have set it up. 
2. **Kitchen duty**: Tom had kitchen duty and was responsible for unlocking the kitchen by 5:00 a.m. This is a potential window of opportunity for Tom to sneak out and set up the prank. However, Tom's kitchen duty would have started hours before the prank occurred.
3. **Allie's absence**: Allie took Cindy to the ER around midnight and hadn't returned yet. It's unlikely that Allie would have had time to set up the prank before leaving for the ER.
4. **Danny's alibi**: Danny was on a 20-mile hike with the campers until late the night before and didn't return until everyone went to bed. He couldn't have set up the prank after returning, as the prank occurred before he was even aware of it. However, he was present in the morning and had an opportunity to set up the prank during the hike or earlier in the night.
5. **Diane's role**: As the prankster herself, Diane would have had access to the cabin and the buckets of ice water. She had the motive to set up a prank and the opportunity to do so.

Given these points, it seems that the most likely culprit is **Diane**, as she had the access, motive, and opportunity to set up the prank herself.",Unknown,Tom,63
"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence presented in the poem.

1.  The evidence is that one of the four guards - Bo, John, John's wife, or Nathan Drew - left the gate unlocked, which could compromise the safety of the fort and its inhabitants.
2.  Nate, the leader, had tied the rope around the gate, and it was discovered to be untied. He then investigates the four guards and questions each one.
3.  The first guard, John, says he didn't leave the gate untied and mentions that his wife was standing guard with him until late afternoon. John's wife also confirms this.
4.  The second guard, Bo, claims he didn't leave the gate untied, but admits that he got sleepy and couldn't see the gate after a certain time. However, his crippled hand makes it difficult for him to work at night, and he is used to working by daylight.
5.  The third guard, Nathan Drew, says he didn't leave the gate untied and claims he was the relief guard for John and stood sentry by the wall throughout the night.

Now, let's analyze the clues and reasoning:

*   John and his wife have an alibi, as they were standing guard together until late afternoon.
*   Bo's crippled hand makes it difficult for him to work at night, but he admits to getting sleepy and not seeing the gate after a certain time. However, this doesn't necessarily mean he left the gate untied.
*   Nathan Drew claims to have been the relief guard for John and stood sentry by the wall throughout the night. However, this raises a red flag because the poem states that the gate was left unlocked, and the rope was untied. If Nathan Drew was standing guard, he would have likely noticed if someone had untied the rope or if the gate was left unlocked.
*   Nate's final clue suggests that he had tied the rope very tightly, making it difficult to untangle during the night. This implies that the person who left the gate unlocked must have had access to the gate and the rope during the night, when Nate was not actively guarding it.

Based on this analysis, the most likely suspect is Nathan Drew, as he claims to have been standing guard throughout the night, but the gate was left unlocked. This raises the possibility that Nathan Drew might have been the one who left the gate unlocked, as he had access to the gate and the rope during the night.

GUILTY: Nathan Drew",Nathan Drew,Nathan Drew,64
"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence carefully and explain my reasoning step by step.

1.  The first clue given is that each of the soldiers arrived at the location with a back pack, which could easily conceal a bundle of dynamite. However, this clue alone does not provide any specific information about the identity of the spy.
2.  The next clue is that Sergeant Stoker asks, ""Who arrived here first?"" Parker answers that he arrived first, followed by McMurty, then Winslow, and finally Garrett. However, Garrett claims that he arrived first but had a lazy horse. This inconsistency suggests that Garrett might be hiding something.
3.  The sergeant then asks where each of the soldiers is sleeping, and Garrett claims to be sleeping under a tree that blocks the sun. This could be a clever attempt to deflect attention, but it is not a conclusive clue.
4.  When asked about their states of origin, Garrett claims to be from Ohio, while Winslow and McMurty claim to be from West Virginia and Indiana, respectively. Parker claims to be from Illinois. However, Winslow's claim of being from Indiana seems suspicious, as it contradicts his previous statement that he was working in his father's blacksmith shop in West Virginia.
5.  The key to solving the mystery lies in the fact that each of the soldiers had a chance to inspect the bridge and potentially plant the dynamite before the others arrived. However, the sergeant knew that there was no one else near the bridge for miles, and no way to approach it without being seen. This suggests that the spy must have been the first person to arrive at the location.
6.  Based on the information provided, Parker was the first person to arrive, followed by McMurty, then Winslow, and finally Garrett. This means that Winslow had the opportunity to plant the dynamite before the others arrived. However, Winslow's statement that he was from Indiana contradicts his previous statement that he was working in his father's blacksmith shop in West Virginia.
7.  However, looking closer at the conversation between the soldiers, I noticed that Garrett said ""I left just before harvest time came for our family's corn crop."" This statement seems suspicious, and the reason is that the harvest time for corn is typically in the fall, not during the time of year that the soldiers are guarding the railroad tracks. This suggests that Garrett's story about his horse being lazy might be a ruse to cover up his true identity and actions.
8.  Considering the above points, it appears that Garrett's story about his horse being lazy is a fabrication. He likely arrived first and planted the dynamite, and then the other soldiers arrived and corroborated his story. The fact that Garrett's story about his horse being lazy is the only one that doesn't seem to match the situation suggests that he is the spy.

GUILTY: Garrett",Garrett,Parker,65
"To analyze the evidence and determine the guilty person, I will go through the events and clues provided in the story step by step.

1. **Joe Tucker's Behavior**: Joe Tucker was unhappy about the noise level and potential damage from the hockey rink. He expressed his concerns to Tom and TJ, and even threatened to call the cops. However, he slipped on a puddle of ice and fell in Tom's yard, which could be seen as an accident. But, considering the timing, it's worth noting that Joe had a motive to cause damage to the rink.

2. **Salt Brand**: The salt used to ruin the rink was a commonplace brand used by people all over Manitoba to melt ice and improve traction. This information doesn't directly point to any suspect, but it's a piece of evidence that could be used to determine the identity of the vandal.

3. **TJ's Suggestion**: TJ mentioned that he needed to sand Mrs. Lacombe's steps before she goes out to get the paper in the morning. This seems like a genuine concern for his neighbor, but it's worth noting that he also knew about the ice being ""pretty icy around here."" This could be a red herring, but it might also indicate that TJ was aware of the potential for slippery conditions.

4. **Mikey's Sneeze**: Mikey sneezed multiple times throughout the story, which might indicate that he was sick. His mother called to inform TJ that Mikey wouldn't be coming to school due to the flu. However, it's worth noting that Mikey had been at TJ's house the previous night, and his mother mentioned that he was sneezing and coughing badly when he got back home.

5. **Shea's Reaction**: Shea was excited about the new rink and asked when he could come over to play hockey. However, when TJ told him that someone ruined the ice, Shea's reaction was more about the ruined ice than the ruined game. This might suggest that Shea was more interested in playing hockey than the outcome of the game.

6. **Shea's Comment**: Shea mentioned that the Moose game wasn't bad, but TJ hung up the phone quickly. This could be seen as a sign that TJ was trying to hide something, but it's also possible that he just didn't want to talk to Shea anymore.

7. **TJ's Claim**: TJ claimed that he knew who ruined the ice, which suggests that he has some information that we don't have yet.

After analyzing the evidence, I believe that the most likely culprit is **Shea Callaghan**. Here's my reasoning:

- Shea was very interested in playing hockey, and the ruined ice would give him an excuse to get out of playing.
- Shea's reaction to the ruined ice was more about the ice than the ruined game, which suggests that he might have had a motive to ruin the ice.
- Shea had the opportunity to ruin the ice, as he was at TJ's house the previous night and could have snuck out to the rink.
- TJ's claim that he knew who ruined the ice, and the fact that he hung up the phone quickly when talking to Shea, suggests that he might be trying to protect Shea.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **No one stood up or crossed the aisle after the five students boarded the bus at the last stop**: This means the thief had to be one of the five students who were sitting in the bus when Johnny last had his flute.
2. **Johnny was sleeping**: Johnny admits to sleeping, which means he was not actively paying attention to his flute. However, this does not necessarily mean he was asleep at the time the flute was taken.
3. **The bus hit a pothole, and everyone jumped a foot or so off their seats**: This event occurred before the flute was discovered missing. Since everyone jumped off their seats, it's likely that the thief was not someone who was sitting near Johnny, as they would have been affected by the pothole as well.
4. **Marty Nolan was grinning and joking about needing his hockey helmet**: This suggests that Marty might be hiding something or trying to deflect attention from himself.
5. **Ed Tuttle's observation**: Ed notices that no one stood up or crossed the aisle after the five students boarded the bus, which means the thief had to be one of the five students. However, Ed also mentions that he watched the students carefully, which implies that he might have noticed some suspicious behavior.

Based on these observations, let's analyze the suspects:

* **Chloe Streamer**: She was sitting in front of Johnny and was involved in a confrontation with him earlier. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the theft.
* **Lyle Esposito**: Lyle was sitting behind Johnny and had his French horn case open earlier, which might have been an opportunity for the thief to take the flute. However, Lyle's behavior does not seem suspicious, and he was not grinning or joking like Marty.
* **Marty Nolan**: Marty was sitting behind Johnny and was making fun of him earlier. He was also grinning and joking about needing his hockey helmet, which might be a sign of guilt. Additionally, Marty was one of the last to leave the bus, which could have given him an opportunity to take the flute.
* **Susan Moorgate**: Susan was sitting in front of Johnny and was involved in a confrontation with him earlier. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the theft.

Based on the analysis, the most suspicious behavior is exhibited by **Marty Nolan**. His grin and joke about needing his hockey helmet, combined with his sitting position behind Johnny, make him the most likely suspect. Additionally, Marty's hockey bag was bulging with equipment, which could have provided a distraction or an opportunity for the theft.

"To determine who is guilty of slashing the tires, I will analyze the evidence and reasoning step by step.

Step 1: Identify the key clues from each suspect's session:

- Mrs. Roberts: She had a session where she discussed her frustration with her weight loss progress, but she seemed to be making progress in her session, becoming more optimistic. There's no direct connection to the crime.
- Mr. Peters: He had a session where he discussed his nightmares and how they may be related to his issues with his father. He also mentioned that the man in the mask in his dream looked like me, which could be a hint, but he also made a connection to his father, not to the crime.
- Mr. Carlson: He had a session where he discussed his germ phobia and how it was getting worse. He mentioned that he wanted to take it out on someone, but there's no direct connection to the crime.
- Mr. Leamington: He had a session where he discussed his struggles with quitting smoking, but also mentioned that he started smoking as soon as he got up, thinking about his girlfriend dumping him. This could be a clue, but there's no direct connection to the crime.

Step 2: Look for connections between the clues and the crime:

- There is no direct connection between the clues from Mrs. Roberts and the crime.
- Mr. Peters' clue about the man in the mask looking like the detective could be a hint, but it's not a strong connection.
- Mr. Carlson's desire to take it out on someone due to his germ phobia could be a motive for the crime, but there's no direct connection to the crime scene (tire slashing).
- Mr. Leamington's thought process before smoking a cigarette could indicate a lack of control or impulse, which could be a red flag for the crime.

Step 3: Analyze the alibis and timing:

- The crime occurred between the time the detective had a latte at the coffee shop and returned to the office.
- The detective had a session with Mrs. Roberts, then Mr. Peters, then Mr. Carlson, and finally Mr. Leamington.
- The detective didn't mention any other patients or appointments during that time frame.

Step 4: Combine the clues and eliminate suspects:

- Mrs. Roberts has an alibi for the time of the crime, as she was in the detective's office for her session.
- Mr. Peters has a possible motive (the man in the mask looking like the detective), but his alibi is unclear.
- Mr. Carlson's germ phobia and desire to take it out on someone could be a motive, but his alibi is unclear.
- Mr. Leamington started smoking as soon as he got up, which indicates a lack of control or impulse. He also had a session with the detective after the crime occurred, which could mean he was trying to cover his tracks.

Step 5: Determine the guilty person:

Based on the analysis, Mr. Leamington's lack of control and impulse, combined with his session occurring after the crime, makes him the most likely suspect. His session could have been a way to cover his tracks and throw off suspicion.

"Let's analyze the evidence carefully:

1. **The prank was well-planned**: The prankster knew about the tradition of leaving cognac and roses at the real burial site of Edgar Allan Poe and replicated it at the miniature tombstone. This suggests that the prankster is familiar with the group's activities and has been paying attention.

2. **The prankster used a mild sedative**: The use of Doz-a-way, an over-the-counter sleeping medicine, implies that the prankster wanted to induce a state of drowsiness rather than unconsciousness. This suggests that the prankster wanted the friends to sleep through the prank.

3. **Anthony saw the prankster**: Anthony reported seeing a dark-dressed person fumbling with something near the tree around 11:00 pm. This implies that the prankster was still awake and active around that time.

4. **Tommy's reaction**: Tommy felt nauseated and woke up around 5:00 am, which suggests that the Doz-a-way had some effect on him. However, Tommy's stomach is sensitive to medication, which makes him a less likely candidate for the prank.

5. **Stephen's question**: Stephen was the first to notice the miniature tombstone and asked ""What is this?"" This suggests that Stephen might have been the last one to see the prank in progress, as he was the one who asked the question.

6. **Connor and Skylar's alibis**: Connor and Skylar were both asleep by 10:30 pm, according to the timeline. This makes it unlikely that they were the ones who set up the prank.

Considering these points, the most likely culprit is **Stephen**. Here's why:

* Stephen was the first to ask about the miniature tombstone, which suggests that he was the last one to see it being set up.
* Anthony saw a dark-dressed person fumbling with something near the tree around 11:00 pm, which could have been Stephen.
* Stephen was not carrying a backpack or blanket, which might have given him more freedom to move around and set up the prank.

GUILTY: Stephen",Stephen,Connor,69
"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  **The Murder and Theft:** The victim, Red Tembeck, was found dead in his root cellar, with signs of a struggle and a ransacked home. This suggests that the killer was searching for something, specifically the Canadian Maple Leaf gold coins Tembeck had hoarded.

2.  **Snowshoe and Snowmobile Tracks:** The killer used snowshoes to approach the property quietly and snowmobiles to leave the scene. This indicates that the killer wanted to surprise Tembeck and then escape quickly. The snowshoe tracks were unique only in their depth, and the snowmobile tracks merged with a popular snowmobile trail, making it difficult to identify the killer.

3.  **Suspects:**

    *   **Bryan Durell:** He had no known grudge with Tembeck and didn't know the location of the gold coins. However, he heard rumors about Tembeck's gold, which could be a motive. He's an outdoorsman and could have easily used snowshoes and a snowmobile.
    *   **Grieve Collier:** He and Tembeck were once friends but became enemies after Tembeck chased his grandchildren away with a shotgun. Collier admitted that Tembeck showed him the gold coins in the past, which could be a motive. However, he's an old-timer and might not have the physical ability to engage in a violent struggle.
    *   **Jacques Bourbonne:** He had a fierce temper and a history of disputes with Tembeck. He could have used his chainsaw to create a diversion while his accomplice searched for the gold coins. However, there's no direct evidence linking him to the crime scene.
    *   **Ruth Majick:** She was Tembeck's ex-wife and knew about the gold coins. Her café is facing foreclosure, which could be a motive for the crime. She was limping and using a crutch, suggesting she might have an injury or a medical condition that would make it difficult for her to engage in physical activity.

4.  **The Clue:** The key to solving this mystery lies in the fact that Ruth Majick was limping and using a crutch. This could be a clever ruse to distract from her true ability. Considering the injuries and the nature of the crime, I believe Ruth Majick might be the killer. She could have used her knowledge of the gold coins and her familiarity with Tembeck's property to commit the crime. The limp and crutch could be a way to conceal her true mobility and avoid suspicion.

5.  **Conclusion:** Given the evidence and the motive, I believe Ruth Majick is the most likely suspect. Her use of a crutch and limp could be a clever ruse to distract from her true ability to commit the crime.",Unknown,Bryan Durell,70
"To analyze the evidence and determine who is guilty, I will go through the events of the story step by step.

1. Tro's mechanical pencil is left on his desk when the group leaves for lunch. 
2. The room is locked by Steve using a key he obtained from Benjamin.
3. When the group returns from lunch, Tro discovers that his pencil is missing.
4. The only people with access to the room are Steve, who has a key, and Benjamin, who also has a key.

At this point, it seems like Benjamin is the prime suspect, but let's continue analyzing the evidence.

5. Benjamin is in a meeting with Mr. Seldon during lunch, and it's unlikely that he would leave the meeting to steal the pencil and then return to the meeting.
6. Steve has access to the room and is the last person to have used the key before the pencil went missing.
7. However, Steve says that he thinks he knows exactly who took the pencil, which suggests that he has some evidence or reasoning that points to one of the other suspects.
8. Steve then says ""yes, I think I know exactly who took your mechanical pencil,"" which implies that he has a reason to suspect one of the other suspects.

Given the evidence, let's consider the other suspects:

9. Cynthia Kirwan is in the group and could have taken the pencil, but there's no indication that she would want to take a mechanical pencil, which she described as ""graphite smears.""
10. Dan Skinner is also in the group and could have taken the pencil, but he's more interested in his work and is frustrated with his own pencil breaking, which doesn't seem to motivate him to take Tro's pencil.

Considering the evidence and the suspects, the most likely explanation is that Shel Jonas took the pencil. Shel had expressed interest in Tro's mechanical pencil earlier in the story, saying ""I doubt it"" when Tro said he had his eye on it, and then later making a joke about it being a ""delicate"" writing instrument. This suggests that Shel had a motive to take the pencil, and Steve's statement that he knows who took the pencil implies that he has evidence or reasoning that points to Shel.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence carefully and follow the reasoning step by step:

1. **Initial Clues:**
   - Mark is seen riding Matthew's bike after it goes missing. This suggests that Mark might have taken the bike without permission.
   - String is a practical joker, but he claims he wouldn't miss an opportunity to see his prank happen. This raises suspicion about his involvement, but also suggests that he might be telling the truth about not being the one to loosen the axle nuts.

2. **Further Clues:**
   - David has a history of having problems with his bike, and Matthew offers him String's bike to use while his is being repaired. This could be a motive for David to sabotage Matthew's bike, but it's not conclusive evidence.
   - When Matthew's bike is discovered to be sabotaged, David seems genuinely concerned and helps Matthew up after he falls off the bike. This could be a red herring, but it doesn't necessarily indicate guilt.
   - Cory is the first to notice that the axle nuts were loosened and suggests that it was an intentional act of sabotage. However, he doesn't have a clear motive for doing it.

3. **Critical Clues:**
   - String is the one who finds the axle nuts and claims to know who loosened them. This is a crucial piece of evidence that requires further analysis.
   - String's history as a practical joker and his claim that he wouldn't miss an opportunity to see his prank happen are still relevant. However, it's also possible that he's trying to deflect attention from his own involvement.

4. **The Final Clue:**
   - String catches the axle nuts in his hand, suggesting that he must have been close to Matthew's bike when the sabotage occurred. This is a strong indication that String was involved in the sabotage.

Based on the evidence and analysis, the most likely culprit is:

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who is guilty.

1. The trophy was stolen from the display case in the lobby, and the only key to the case belongs to Mr. Carswell. This suggests that Mr. Carswell had the opportunity to steal the trophy.

2. Mr. Carswell has a motive to shift the blame onto someone else. When the theft is discovered, he immediately suspects Barry, a second-grader who might feel resentful about being compared to the 1983 quarterback. This behavior is suspicious, as he might be trying to deflect attention from himself.

3. The police search the entire school, including Mr. Carswell's office, but they find no evidence of the trophy. This suggests that the trophy might be hidden somewhere, and Mr. Carswell might be trying to cover his tracks.

4. Randy, the little person, makes a surprising announcement that he knows where the trophy is. This implies that he has some information that the others don't, and it's possible that he has been in on the theft all along.

5. Casey and Tony are not directly involved in the theft. Casey is more concerned with his image and making money, and Tony is more interested in making money from Casey's appearances. While they might be involved in the scheme in some way, the evidence points more strongly to Mr. Carswell.

6. Barry's alibi checks out - he was in the auditorium during the party, and one of the teachers saw him. This clears him of suspicion.

7. Randy's sudden knowledge of the trophy's location is suspicious, but it's possible that he's trying to protect himself or someone else. However, considering the evidence, it's more likely that he's in on the theft.

Given the analysis, the most likely suspect is Mr. Carswell. He had the opportunity, motive, and means to steal the trophy, and he's trying to shift the blame onto someone else.",Unknown,Tony,73
"To analyze the evidence and solve the mystery, I will break down the events and clues step by step.

1.  Ed's mother is in the kitchen, and the chicken is in the oven. She says it's almost ready and that the peach halves will dry out if they don't eat it right away. This implies that she has access to the chicken and is responsible for its preparation.
2.  Zeke brings a pizza, which gets devoured by Ed's husky and terrier. Zeke tries to chase the husky, but then he turns around to head back towards the house, just in time to see the terrier eating the remaining pizza slices.
3.  Ed's mother is still in the kitchen when Zeke returns, and she is still busy preparing the chicken. This means she is still in the vicinity of the chicken.
4.  Ed and Zeke go to the front yard to address the commotion caused by the terrier and the neighbor's cat. During this time, Ed's mother is in the house, but there is no mention of her leaving the kitchen or leaving the house.
5.  After the commotion, Ed's mother asks Ed and Zeke to wash their hands again, which suggests that she is still in the house, and the chicken is still there.
6.  However, when Ed and Zeke return to the dining room, the chicken has disappeared. The glass dish that covered the chicken is still there, but the chicken is gone.

Considering these events and clues, we can now analyze the suspects:

- Ed: Ed is with Zeke in the front yard when the chicken goes missing, so it's unlikely that he would be the one to steal the chicken.
- Ed's Husky: The husky is eating Zeke's pizza, but there is no indication that it would be interested in the chicken or have access to the dining room.
- Ed's Mother: Ed's mother is in the kitchen when the chicken is being prepared, and she is still in the house when the chicken goes missing. She has access to the dining room and the chicken, and she is the one who prepared the meal. She also has the motivation to keep the chicken for herself, as she is proud of her cooking and wants to enjoy the meal she prepared.

Based on this analysis, the evidence points to Ed's mother as the most likely culprit. She has the opportunity, means, and motive to steal the chicken, making her the prime suspect.

"To determine who is guilty, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **The timing of the missing film**: The VHS copy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman was discovered missing after Jack went upstairs to turn off his computer. This implies that the film was taken after 9:00 p.m., when the family was cleaning up and watching TV, and before Jack went upstairs. Since Andy was already in bed downstairs due to a twisted ankle, he is unlikely to have taken the film.

2. **Matthew's alibi**: Matthew went upstairs to find his toothbrush and called Candace to help him. This means he was upstairs during the time the film went missing. However, it's possible for him to have quickly taken the film and then called for help.

3. **David's alibi**: David went inside once to get soft drinks for everyone and then went back outside. He didn't have a reason to go upstairs to the office library after that. However, he could have taken the film before going back outside.

4. **Dennis's alibi**: Dennis was in the sandbox with Candace until dark and then went inside with the family. He didn't have a reason to go upstairs to the office library. However, he could have taken the film while the family was cleaning up.

5. **The behavior of the suspects**: When Jack confronted the family about the missing film, Candace said, ""I have seen and heard everything tonight. I know who has that silly film."" This suggests that Candace might have seen or heard something that points to one of the boys. Since Candace was busy getting the boys clean clothes and watching the news, she would have had a clear view of the boys' activities.

6. **Candace's statement**: When Candace said she knew who took the film, she was likely referring to the fact that she had seen one of the boys searching for something upstairs. Given that Matthew was searching for his toothbrush upstairs, it's likely that Candace saw him and realized that he might have taken the film.

Based on the analysis, the most likely culprit is **Matthew**. He was upstairs searching for his toothbrush, which could have been a ruse to take the film, and Candace's statement suggests that she saw or heard something that pointed to him.",Unknown,David,75
"Let's analyze the evidence carefully and follow the instructions.

1. Analyze the evidence:

- Suzie and Dan are on a stakeout to catch a house robber in the neighborhood.
- Mrs. Krantz suspects Mike Creighton of being the robber, but her reasoning seems flimsy (he's new to the neighborhood and walks his dog near the crime scenes).
- Jill, a jogger, is flirtatious with Dan and seems to be watching him. However, she doesn't seem to be hiding anything suspicious.
- Dan's father is a detective, and Suzie is his girlfriend.
- Dan's father is being paid by Mrs. Krantz to investigate the case.
- A woman named Wanda is robbed, but Suzie claims to know who took her wedding ring.

2. Explain my reasoning step by step:

- Suzie's comment about knowing who took Wanda's wedding ring suggests that she might be involved in the robberies.
- Dan seems to be genuinely trying to solve the case and is not suspiciously acting.
- Jill seems to be flirting with Dan, but there's no evidence that she's involved in the robberies.
- Mrs. Krantz's motives for hiring Dan's father to investigate the case are unclear, but her behavior seems suspicious (she's been keeping an eye on Mike Creighton and has a history of accusing him of the robberies).
- Wanda's robbery seems to be a red herring, as Suzie claims to know who took her wedding ring.

3. Based on the evidence, the most suspicious character is Suzie, as she claims to know who took Wanda's wedding ring and seems to be hiding something. However, let's consider another option: Mrs. Krantz. Her motives for hiring Dan's father to investigate the case are unclear, and she seems to be manipulating the situation to frame Mike Creighton.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence provided:

1.  Trevor Jones, the victim, was found dead in the small pool reserved for Masterson's top five employees. The time of death is not specified, but it is known that the group left the pool to go to lunch together.
2. Niles Anderson, the accountant, claimed to have eaten bad poke the night before and spent the night with stomach pains, then slept in and didn't leave his room until he went to meet the others for lunch. This means he was not present at the pool when Trevor was last seen.
3. Amanda Kent, the office manager, has a phobia of water due to a near-drowning incident as a child. She is terrified of water and would not have been swimming in the pool.
4. Stephanie Clark, the marketing VP, did not have any alibi for the time of the murder and was at the pool with the others earlier.
5. Craig Willis, the vice president, claimed that they all left the pool together, but then went to their rooms before meeting back up at the buffet. However, this does not necessarily mean he was not present at the pool at the time of the murder.

Considering the evidence, I can rule out Amanda Kent as the killer because she was not in the pool due to her fear of water.

Next, I will consider Niles Anderson's alibi. If he was indeed sick and slept in, it's possible he could have snuck back to the pool to commit the crime without anyone noticing.

However, I notice that Niles Anderson is the only one who made a comment about Trevor Jones' leadership style being similar to that of a drill sergeant. This could be a red herring, but it also could be a genuine feeling of resentment that Niles harbors towards Trevor. On the other hand, Craig Willis, Amanda Kent, and Stephanie Clark all seem to have reasons to dislike Trevor, but they also seem to be trying to put on a united front.

The key piece of evidence that points to the killer is the fact that only one of them is a murderer. Given the scenario, I believe that the killer is the one who had the opportunity to commit the crime without being seen.

Considering the alibis and the dynamics between the group members, I conclude that Niles Anderson was not at the pool when the others left for lunch, making him the most likely suspect.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The group of friends, consisting of a ghost, a werewolf, a vampire, a mummy, and a witch, enter a crypt in a cemetery on Halloween night, seeking to prove their bravery. They joke about the possibility of encountering monsters, but their main concern is to see if the coffins inside the crypt are occupied by mummies or vampires.

2.  As they enter the crypt, the door slams shut behind them, trapping them inside. The group waits in the darkness, and eventually, Linda finds a flashlight. When she shines it around, she points it directly at Wendell's eyes, causing him to react. This action suggests that Linda might be trying to distract or disorient someone.

3.  The group discovers a hole in the crypt wall, which they assume was made by a monster trying to escape. However, when they investigate, they find that the hole was made by someone who was small enough to fit through it, which makes it unlikely that the monster was a large one.

4.  Wendell steps outside through the hole, but screams and runs back to open the door. When he does, the group sees zombies emerging from the graves. However, the zombies seem fake, and it becomes apparent that they were created using foam-filled latex.

5.  The key piece of evidence is that the top half of a zombie is found in the same position at the back of the crypt as it was at the front. This suggests that the zombies were placed in the graves before the group entered the crypt.

6.  Considering the fact that the zombies were fake and placed in the graves, it is likely that the person who set up the trap was the one who had the opportunity to create and place the zombies.

7.  The only person who had access to the crypt before the group entered was Linda. She was the one who found the flashlight and shone it around the crypt, which caused Wendell to react. This action could have been a distraction to allow her to set up the trap.

8.  Additionally, Linda's comment about the group's bravery being a test for the ""grown-ups from the children"" earlier in the story suggests that she might be trying to prove a point. Her actions in the crypt, including finding the flashlight and setting up the zombies, are consistent with this goal.

Based on this analysis, the evidence points to Linda as the guilty party. Her actions and comments throughout the story suggest that she was the mastermind behind the trap, and her ability to set up the fake zombies in the graves before the group entered the crypt makes her the most likely suspect.

"To solve this mystery, I'll analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  Andreas Scolari reported that his lunch was stolen from the breakroom fridge between 1:00 p.m. and his lunch break start-time. The list of people who were in the office during this time is: Andreas Scolari, Pete Stampkowski, Beryl Hives, Dawn de Jong, and the narrator (the office manager).

2.  Beryl Hives mentioned that she had a cigarette break from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. and didn't eat any food during this time. She also mentioned that she has dentures and can't eat hard foods, which rules her out as a suspect.

3.  Dawn de Jong claimed that she didn't eat lunch and instead had fruits and nuts at her desk. She also turned down the narrator's invitation to go out with her due to being lactose intolerant. However, there's no evidence to confirm that she didn't eat any food during this time.

4.  Pete Stampkowski was at the snack machine around the time Andreas Scolari's lunch was stolen, but he claimed to have eaten at a restaurant from 11:45 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. This alibi seems suspicious, as it doesn't entirely rule out the possibility of him eating Andreas' lunch.

5.  Konrad Pushkin was contacted by the narrator and asked to pick up food from the market on his way home. However, he denied any involvement in the theft and mentioned that he already gave the office the food money for the week.

6.  The key evidence found in the dumpster was a brown paper bag containing a collection of bread crusts, a shiny red apple, a fistful of orange peels, and an empty milk chocolate bar wrapper. This suggests that the thief ate the contents of Andreas' lunch, which includes an apple and a milk chocolate bar.

7.  Given the evidence and the timeline, the most suspicious person is Pete Stampkowski. He was at the snack machine around the time Andreas' lunch was stolen and claimed to have eaten at a restaurant from 11:45 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., which might be an alibi, but not a strong one. The food in the dumpster matches the items in Andreas' lunch, and the empty wrapper of the milk chocolate bar is a strong indication of the thief's identity.

"To determine the guilty person, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. The stage manager was in charge of the props and had access to the prop closet where the suitcase with the money was hidden. He mentioned that he had checked the prop closet before the show and couldn't find the suitcase, which suggests that he might have taken it.

2. The stage manager also seemed evasive and nervous when questioned by the police, which could indicate guilt.

3. Mr. Green, the comedy writer, had a motive to steal the money as he had written the skit and would benefit from the publicity and potential business opportunities that would come with it. However, there is no direct evidence linking him to the crime.

4. Dusty, the actress, had a motive to steal the money as she seemed to be struggling financially and would benefit from the $10,000. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the crime.

5. Bumbo, the clown, seemed suspiciously calm and collected when questioned by the police, which could indicate guilt. However, there is no direct evidence linking him to the crime.

6. The police reviewed the evidence and found that only one person had entered the prop closet, but unfortunately, they couldn't identify the person due to the brief glimpse of a pant leg.

7. However, the police also mentioned that the cameraman had been pointing his camera at the floor for the previous hour, which means that someone in the control booth could see the ground in front of the closet. This suggests that the thief might have been someone who had access to the control booth.

Considering these points, the stage manager had access to the prop closet, was evasive and nervous when questioned, and had the opportunity to take the money. The fact that the police couldn't identify the person who entered the prop closet doesn't necessarily rule out the stage manager, as they could have used their position in the control booth to access the closet without being seen.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **The chess pieces were stolen**: The chessboard had all its pieces, but 16 pawns were missing. This suggests that the thief was trying to sabotage the chess boxing event, making it impossible for the contestants to play the chess part of the game.

2. **The suspects' behaviors**: 
   - Ernie: Ernie was too focused on his training and didn't seem to have the opportunity or motivation to steal the chess pieces. He was also confident in his strategy, which suggests that he didn't need to sabotage the event.
   - Gordon: Gordon was acting suspiciously when questioned by the referee. He joked about having a spare chess set, which could be seen as a way to deflect suspicion. However, his behavior could also be interpreted as a way to make light of the situation.
   - Jesse: Jesse made a startled announcement about the missing pawns, which suggests that he was surprised by the discovery. However, he could have been trying to distract the referee or create an opportunity to steal the pieces himself.
   - Mac: Mac was not a chess player and didn't seem to have any interest in the chess part of the game. However, he was a boxer, and stealing the chess pieces could have given him an unfair advantage in the boxing part of the game.

3. **Motivation**: The motivation behind stealing the chess pieces is crucial. The thief wanted to sabotage the chess boxing event, which suggests that they wanted to prevent the chess boxers from competing or winning. This could be a way to help Mac, who was a boxer and not a chess player, gain an advantage.

4. **Opportunity**: The opportunity to steal the chess pieces was available to all suspects, but Jesse had the most plausible opportunity to steal the pieces without being detected. He was in the room where the chessboard was located and made a startled announcement when the missing pawns were discovered.

Considering all the evidence, the most likely suspect is Jesse. He had the opportunity to steal the pieces, and his behavior suggests that he might have been trying to distract the referee or create an opportunity to steal the pieces himself. Additionally, his calm demeanor and lack of concern for the missing pawns could indicate that he was not as innocent as he seemed.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Evidence of Mr. Storimon's behavior**: Mr. Storimon is described as a rude and arrogant man who is desperate for respect. He is also shown to be dishonest, as he accuses Mick of stealing his wallet without even checking the puddle where it fell. This suggests that Mr. Storimon is prone to deception and is willing to shift blame onto others.

2. **The wallet's contents**: Initially, Mr. Storimon claims that his wallet was full of hundred-dollar bills, but when it's recovered from the puddle, it only contains twenty-dollar bills. This discrepancy raises suspicions about Mr. Storimon's honesty and the possibility that he might have altered the contents of his wallet.

3. **The police officer's behavior**: The police officer is eating a doughnut and seems to be enjoying himself, but he's also aware of the situation and is trying to appear neutral. However, his second bite of the doughnut, just as Mick accuses him of stealing the hundreds, suggests that he might be hiding something.

4. **The timing of the events**: The police officer finds the wallet in the puddle, but Mr. Storimon had already accused Mick of stealing it. This raises the possibility that the police officer might have had time to switch the contents of the wallet during the commotion.

5. **Mick's behavior**: Mick is described as being scared of the police, which is understandable given the laws against vagrancy. However, he's also quick to accuse the police officer of stealing the hundreds, which suggests that he's not afraid of the police as much as he's perceptive of their behavior.

6. **Danny's behavior**: Danny is shown to be a bit of a troublemaker, but he's also shown to be a bit of a rebel who doesn't like authority. While he's suspicious, there's no concrete evidence to link him to the crime.

7. **The final clue**: The key to the mystery lies in the fact that the police officer takes a second bite of his doughnut while Mick accuses him of stealing the hundreds. This suggests that the police officer is guilty and is trying to hide his guilt by continuing to eat his doughnut.

Considering these points, the most likely explanation is that the police officer stole the hundreds from Mr. Storimon's wallet while everyone was distracted by the argument. The police officer's behavior, combined with the discrepancy in the wallet's contents, suggests that he is the one who committed the crime.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  Sandra O'Malley claims that she was sent by her boss, Quinton Jesselton, to retrieve the stock certificates from Arnold Grossmecker's office. She says she entered the office, found the certificates, and placed them in a manila envelope. However, when she handed the envelope to Jesselton, it was empty.
2.  Sandra then reenacts the scene for the detective, and this time, the outcome is different. She finds the certificates in the desk drawer, places them in a manila envelope, and hands it to Jesselton. However, this time, the envelope is not empty.
3.  This discrepancy suggests that the first time Sandra entered the office, she may not have actually taken the certificates, but rather, someone else may have taken them and made it look like she did.
4.  Let's examine the events of the first reenactment: Sandra enters the office, finds the certificates, and places them in a manila envelope. However, she doesn't actually see the certificates being taken. She only sees the large manila envelope on the floor, which she picks up. This implies that someone else may have taken the certificates while Sandra was distracted.
5.  Who could have taken the certificates? Let's consider the suspects:
   - Arnold Grossmecker: He could have taken the certificates and framed Sandra.
   - Brigid Jellicoe: She could have taken the certificates and helped Grossmecker frame Sandra.
   - Quinton Jesselton: He could have taken the certificates and used Sandra as a pawn to get to Grossmecker.
   - Sandra O'Malley: She could have taken the certificates, but this seems unlikely, given the second reenactment.
6.  Now, let's analyze the second reenactment: Sandra finds the certificates, places them in a manila envelope, and hands it to Jesselton. This time, the envelope is not empty. However, this reenactment was staged by the detective, and Sandra was not actually retrieving the certificates.
7.  The only person who could have taken the certificates in the second reenactment is the detective himself. He had access to the office and could have planted the certificates in the desk drawer.
8.  However, the detective is not a suspect in the original list. We need to look for another explanation.
9.  Let's re-examine the first reenactment: Sandra enters the office, finds the certificates, and places them in a manila envelope. However, the large manila envelope on the floor is not touched by anyone. This suggests that the certificates may have been hidden in the large manila envelope all along.
10. Who could have hidden the certificates in the large manila envelope? The only person who had access to the office and the envelopes is Brigid Jellicoe. She could have hidden the certificates in the large manila envelope and made it look like Sandra took them.
11. However, this theory doesn't explain why Brigid would hide the certificates. Let's consider another possibility: Brigid could have been trying to frame Grossmecker for the theft. She could have hidden the certificates in the large manila envelope and made it look like Grossmecker took them.
12. This theory is consistent with the events of the reenactment: Grossmecker enters the office, sees the large manila envelope on the floor, and assumes it's the one with the certificates. He doesn't actually take the certificates, but Brigid makes it look like he did.
13. Therefore, the most plausible explanation is that Brigid Jellicoe is the one who stole the stock certificates and framed Grossmecker.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence and reasoning step by step:

1. **Timing of the murder:** The murder occurred between 2:00 AM and 3:00 AM, as the coroner estimated the time of death to be around 2:00 AM, and the last person to talk to Melody was Nancy, who hung up her phone around 2:30 AM.

2. **Vernon's alibi:** Vernon claims to have gone to bed at 11:30 PM and heard John come in downstairs as he was drifting off to sleep. However, he didn't notice anything unusual when he woke up the next morning.

3. **John's alibi:** John says he came home around midnight, watched TV, and went to bed around 3:00 AM. However, he didn't hear anything unusual, and his alibi relies on the fact that the lights were out, making it difficult to see what he was doing.

4. **Nancy's alibi:** Nancy says she was on the phone with her friend Beth from 12:00 AM to 2:30 AM. Her alibi is solid, but she might have had the opportunity to get up and commit the crime during her conversation.

5. **Constance's alibi:** Constance says she went to bed before midnight and didn't see or talk to anyone until the next morning. However, she claims she didn't account for her time during the window of the murder, which raises suspicions.

Now, let's analyze Constance's statement more closely: ""The game is up."" This phrase suggests that Constance knows she's been caught or that she's been found out. She says she can't account for her time during the window of the murder, but this could be a clever way of saying she was actually awake and present in the house during that time.

Furthermore, Constance's statement ""I don't have to because it doesn't make any difference"" implies that she knows she has an alibi that would clear her of suspicion, but she's choosing not to reveal it. This behavior is suspicious and suggests that Constance is hiding something.

Considering the evidence, I believe Constance is the most likely suspect. Her ambiguous statement and the fact that she's not providing a clear alibi during the window of the murder make her a strong suspect.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and follow these steps:

1. Analyze the evidence:
   - The thief wore a Santa suit, which means they were trying to disguise themselves.
   - The candy cane was dragged out of the store on the floor, suggesting it was not carried by someone who had a significant physical limitation.
   - The loading dock was used, indicating that the thief had access to a vehicle that could fit the candy cane.
   - There was no forced entry, suggesting that the thief had a key to the store.
   - A thin line of red and white shavings was found on the loading dock, which tasted sweet.

2. Explain the reasoning step by step:
   - The thief had access to a vehicle that could fit the candy cane, which suggests that the thief might be someone who has a department that involves transporting or handling large items. This could be Frank, who manages the Power Tools department and has a new car.
   - The thief was not hindered by their size, as they were able to drag the candy cane out of the store. This suggests that the thief is not someone with physical limitations like Michael, who has a hamstring injury and was struggling to lift a small elf garden gnome.
   - The fact that there was no forced entry and the thief had a key to the store suggests that the thief is one of the people who work at the store and have access to keys.
   - The sweet taste of the shavings suggests that they were from the candy cane, and the fact that they were on the loading dock suggests that the thief was trying to clean up any evidence of their crime.
   - Considering the above points, Frank is the most likely suspect. He has access to a vehicle that could fit the candy cane, he is physically able to drag the candy cane out of the store, and he has a key to the store.

"To determine who stole Russell's dagger, let's analyze the evidence and reasoning step by step:

1. **Initial Suspicion**: Russell's friends are initially suspicious, but no one admits to taking the dagger. This suggests that none of them want to implicate themselves, and they're trying to deflect attention.

2. **Paul's Admission**: Paul admits to returning to the attic the previous day to look at the dagger, but he claims it was too dark to see well. This raises a red flag, as Paul has a motive to go back to the attic.

3. **Mitch's Admission**: Mitch also admits to being tempted to go back to the attic but decided not to. However, Russell notices that Mitch has no band-aid on his fingers, despite claiming to have cut his finger slicing tomatoes. This inconsistency raises suspicions about Mitch's credibility.

4. **Matthew's Alibi**: Matthew claims to have slept for a couple of hours after having a few beers, but he can't prove it. This lack of a solid alibi makes him a potential suspect.

5. **Chris's Alibi**: Chris claims to have taken a walk around the neighborhood early Saturday morning and saw their neighbor waving to him. This alibi seems solid, but we'll keep an eye on it.

6. **The Bloody Band-Aid**: Russell finds a bloody band-aid in the guest room where Mitch and Alycia are staying. This suggests that Mitch might have been injured while taking the dagger.

7. **Myra's Tip**: Myra Benham mentions hearing heavy male snoring in the Light's guest bedroom yesterday afternoon. This could be a clue to Matthew's whereabouts during the time the dagger went missing.

Considering these points, let's evaluate each suspect:

- **Chris Palmer**: Chris has a solid alibi, and there's no evidence linking him to the crime.
- **Matthew Light**: Matthew's lack of a solid alibi and the possibility of heavy male snoring in his guest bedroom raise suspicions. However, it's not conclusive evidence.
- **Mitchell Land**: Mitch's inconsistent story about cutting his finger and the bloody band-aid in his guest room make him a strong suspect.
- **Paul Benham**: Paul's admission to returning to the attic, despite claiming it was too dark, raises suspicions. However, there's no concrete evidence linking him to the crime.
- **Russell Smith**: As the owner of the dagger, Russell has a clear motive to stage the theft. However, he seems genuinely distraught and has provided a detailed account of the events.

Based on the evidence, the most likely culprit is:

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The X-Box was found smashed in the guest cottage, and there was only one set of footprints leading to the window - Emily's. This suggests that Emily was the only one who could have entered the cottage through the window.
2.  The cottage was locked, but the window was left open for ventilation. This implies that someone with a key to the cottage could have entered through the door.
3.  The only people with keys to the cottage were Angelita, Jessica, and Percy. However, the presence of Emily's footprints suggests that she was the one who entered the cottage through the window.
4.  Emily had a motive to smash the X-Box. She was terrified of Percy's temper, which was like a ""ticking time bomb waiting to go off."" She feared that Percy might do something violent if he saw the smashed X-Box, so she smashed it to prevent that from happening.
5.  Emily's actions were a desperate attempt to prevent a potentially violent situation. This suggests that she was acting out of self-preservation, rather than malice.
6.  While Percy, Angelita, and Jessica all had motives to smash the X-Box, Emily's actions were the most likely explanation for the crime.

"To determine the guilty party, let's analyze the evidence carefully.

1.  The lady suggests playing a game of cards to pass the time, and the gunslinger instantly pulls out a deck of cards, which suggests they might have a hidden agenda. This behavior could be a ruse for a hold-up, but it's not conclusive evidence of cheating.

2.  The gunslinger's actions are suspicious, as he keeps his cards facedown in his lap and only peels back the top edges to see what he has. This behavior is unusual for a poker player, as most players like to keep their cards visible. This behavior could indicate that he's trying to hide something.

3.  The sheriff is cautious and keeps his cards close to his vest, which is a common behavior for a lawman trying to maintain control and not reveal his hand. However, he doesn't exhibit any behavior that suggests he's cheating.

4.  The cowboy loses steadily, which could indicate that he's not cheating or that he's not very skilled at poker. His behavior is mostly innocent, and he doesn't exhibit any suspicious behavior.

5.  When Frank Clairmont points out the scratches on the cards, the gunslinger's reaction is immediate and defensive, which could indicate guilt. The fact that he asks, ""You saying that somebody's marked the cards, mister?"" suggests that he's trying to deflect attention from himself.

6.  The lady's reaction is helpful, but it's also possible that she's trying to deflect attention from herself by pointing out the gunslinger's suspicious behavior.

7.  The sheriff's reaction is slow and cautious, which suggests that he might be trying to maintain his cover as a lawman.

8.  The fact that the gunslinger has a revolver on his hip and keeps his hands free during the game suggests that he's prepared for a confrontation, which could indicate that he's planning to use force to get what he wants.

Based on this analysis, the evidence points to the gunslinger as the most likely suspect. His suspicious behavior, defensive reaction to Frank's accusations, and the fact that he's prepared for a confrontation all suggest that he's the guilty party.

"To analyze the evidence and solve the mystery, I will carefully examine the timeline of events and the movements of the customers.

1. 10:20: Leon sees Ed Puckett in the dressing room, then Louis Murphy is in the fitting room, and Gene Roberts is browsing the edge of the men's area.
2. 10:25: Ed Puckett leaves the dressing room, and Gene Roberts is escorted to the dress shirt table by Leon.
3. 10:30: Justin Tanner arrives and asks about the men's sweaters. Leon walks him to the sweater table while Louis is still in the fitting room.
4. 10:36: Leon checks on Louis and sees him walking away from the mirror and returning to his dressing room.
5. 10:45: Justin enters the fitting room with a green sweater, and Louis is still in his dressing room.
6. 10:50: George Whitley asks Leon about a catalog order, which takes a few minutes to complete.
7. 11:04: Justin leaves the men's department without purchasing the sweater.
8. 11:10: Leon checks on Louis and finds him dead in the dressing room.

From the timeline, we can see that Louis was in the dressing room from 10:20 to 10:36, then again from 10:45 until he was found dead at 11:10. This means that during the time period from 10:36 to 10:45, Louis was alone in the dressing room, and no one else was in the fitting room.

However, the security tapes reveal that the murderer is one of the three customers who were in the men's department during this time period: Ed Puckett, Gene Roberts, or George Whitley.

Considering the timeline, we can eliminate Justin Tanner, as he was in the sweater area from 10:30 to 10:45 and then left the men's department at 11:04.

Now, let's examine the possible scenarios for each of the remaining suspects:

- Ed Puckett: Ed was in the dressing room from 10:20 to 10:25 and then was in the shoe department. However, he was not in the dressing room during the time period from 10:36 to 10:45.
- Gene Roberts: Gene was in the men's area from 10:25 to 10:45 and was escorted by Leon to the dress shirt table. He was still in the men's department when Louis was found dead at 11:10.
- George Whitley: George was in the shoe department from 10:20 to 10:50, but he was not in the dressing room during the time period from 10:36 to 10:45.

Based on the timeline and the security tapes, the only person who was in the dressing room from 10:36 to 10:45 is Gene Roberts. This means that Gene Roberts had the opportunity to commit the crime, and the security tapes reveal that he is the murderer.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence provided.

Step 1: Analyze the scene and identify potential evidence.
- The children are in a large candy store with various sections, including a soft chocolate section that is partially roped off for remodeling.
- The children are accompanied by their mothers, who have set a rule that no candy can be purchased until after lunch.
- Emilee is offered a free sample by Mr. Darby but declines, citing her mother's rule.
- Brianna is distracted by the brownies and cookies in a glass case but doesn't seem to take any.
- Trevor is in the licorice section, which is unusual for him due to his recent dental issue.
- Justin is in the soft chocolate section, which is partially roped off.
- Olivia (Livvie) is with her mother and does not stray far.

Step 2: Look for clues that point to a specific suspect.
- Emilee is the only child who had a direct conversation with Mr. Darby, who mentions that one of his clerks reported that someone had a snack they forgot to pay for. This suggests that Emilee may be involved.
- Emilee had previously considered asking her mother to buy a few ounces of heart-shaped mints, which implies she had an interest in candy.
- Emilee is not in the soft chocolate section when Mr. Darby mentions that someone had a snack they forgot to pay for, which means she is not likely the one who took the chocolate.
- Trevor is in the licorice section, which is not the area where the chocolate was taken.
- Justin is in the soft chocolate section, which is partially roped off. However, the area is messy, and Mr. Darby had left a step stool, paint drop cloth, and loose pieces of wood on the floor. This suggests that the chocolate may have been taken from this area, and Justin may be involved.
- Brianna and Olivia do not have any direct connections to the soft chocolate section.
- Alicia says she knows who the guilty party is without Mr. Darby having to tell her, which suggests that she has some insight into the situation.

Step 3: Combine the clues to form a conclusion.
- Emilee had a conversation with Mr. Darby, which may have led to her being offered a free sample. However, this does not necessarily mean she took the chocolate.
- Justin is in the area where the chocolate was likely taken, and the area is messy, which could make it easy to access the chocolate without being noticed.
- Alicia's confidence in knowing who the guilty party is suggests that she has some insight into the situation.

Step 4: Make a final determination.
Considering the evidence, the most likely culprit is Justin Cates. He was in the soft chocolate section, which is where the chocolate was likely taken, and the area was messy, making it easy to access the chocolate. Alicia's confidence in knowing who the guilty party is also suggests that she may have some insight into Justin's actions.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. Hal mentions that he saw Tor Hansen watching him from his front window as he was bringing the 50-pound bag of birdseed into his barn the previous day. Tor claims that he saw Hal dragging the sack into the barn, which suggests that he was aware of the birdseed's presence. However, this doesn't necessarily mean he stole it.

2. Hal visits Billy Mumms and sees two large birdhouses on his property with purple martins fluttering around. Billy claims that he doesn't feed the martins, but Hal is skeptical since they're so abundant. However, there's no direct connection between the birdseed and Billy.

3. Hal visits Cheryl Judson and sees a mama duck and her brood in the creek behind her house. Cheryl denies any involvement with the missing birdseed, but her behavior seems suspicious, as she's chopping wood with a razor-sharp axe and seems to be avoiding Hal's questions.

4. Hal visits Stan Mifflin, who shows him his exotic birds and claims that he only feeds them nuts and fresh fruit. However, when Hal asks if he needs a lot of birdseed to feed his birds, Stan's parrot suddenly caws ""Awk! Nuts and fresh fruit only, please!"" This suggests that Stan might be trying to deceive Hal about his diet.

5. The key piece of evidence is that Hal realizes one of his neighbors has lied to him after his visit to Stan Mifflin. The fact that Stan's parrot caws about not wanting birdseed, while Stan is trying to convince Hal that he doesn't need it, suggests that Stan is hiding something.

Considering all the evidence, it appears that Stan Mifflin is the most likely culprit. Stan's parrot's reaction to the mention of birdseed, combined with his attempts to deceive Hal about his diet, suggests that he might be hiding something. Additionally, Stan's eccentric behavior and his enthusiasm for birds make it more believable that he would steal birdseed to feed his exotic birds.

2.  Roger then mentions that when he looked back at the monkey cage, he saw the two chimps holding hands and both wearing cowboy hats. This means that the person who took the hat had to have done so before the students exited the feeding area, as the chimps were seen wearing the hats after they exited.

3.  Next, we need to look at the behavior of each suspect in the story.

   a.  Cindy: Cindy seemed to be a knowledgeable and enthusiastic student who loved animals. She was seen talking to the Cockatoo and explaining its intelligence. She also seemed to be genuinely interested in the animals and their behavior. There is no evidence in the story that suggests Cindy would be a practical joker.

   b.  Henry: Henry seemed to be a nervous and anxious student who often apologized for his mistakes. He dropped a piece of fruit on the ground and then trembled when he picked up a cantaloupe. However, he did manage to remove the plate of food from the fridge without dropping anything in the chimpanzee area. This suggests that Henry might be capable of doing a task without messing up, but his nervous behavior could also be a red herring.

   c.  Leonard: Leonard was a zookeeper who was known for playing practical jokes. He was seen smiling and shrugging when Roger mentioned his last prank, and he was the one who was laughing when Roger's hat went missing. This suggests that Leonard might be a good suspect.

   d.  Tom: Tom seemed to be a laid-back and somewhat lazy student who was more interested in his baseball game than the animals. He made some thoughtless comments about the animals, but there is no evidence in the story that suggests he would be a practical joker.

4.  Putting all the evidence together, the most likely suspect is Leonard. He was a known practical joker, and he was the one who was laughing when Roger's hat went missing. This suggests that he might have taken the hat and put it in the monkey cage as a prank.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence carefully and explain my reasoning step by step.

1. The theft of the valuable pages of the King James Bible occurred on the night before the service, when Elmer Tydings grabbed the book and left the church after an argument.
2. Elmer claims that he soon thought better of things and returned the book to the church later that night, with his wife Katherine driving the car and putting the book through the donation slot. Katherine corroborates his story, and there is a witness who saw her walking from her car to the church.
3. However, there is a discrepancy in Elmer's alibi: his friend Tom's brother, a patrolman, saw Elmer watching a show on television that night, and Elmer claims to have watched the same show with Katherine. This suggests that Elmer may have been watching TV at home, rather than returning the book to the church.
4. The door to the church was locked, but nobody checked the donations for hours, and the volunteer librarian, Louise Stubbs, didn't recall seeing the book. She had a sleepless night after the church meeting and didn't go to the church after finishing work at the town library.
5. The Vicar was the only one who knew that the book had been returned, and he was telephoned by Katherine that night. However, he didn't make it to church until late the following afternoon, and when he found out the book was missing, he called the police and gave them a statement.
6. The fact that the Vicar was willing to let Elmer off the hook if the book was returned suggests that he may have been trying to protect someone else. This, combined with the fact that Elmer's alibi doesn't hold up, raises suspicions about Elmer's guilt.
7. However, we need to consider the other suspects as well. John Stubbs has a strong motive to steal the book, as his wife Louise knew its value and he would benefit from the sale of the book. However, he has no clear alibi and no one corroborates his story.
8. Katherine Tydings has a motive to return the book, as she opposed the sale of the book and wanted it to stay in the village. However, her alibi is shaky, and her husband's story about watching TV together is suspicious.
9. Louise Stubbs has a strong motive to steal the book, as she would benefit from the sale of the book and could have used the sleepless night to her advantage. However, her alibi is shaky, and she didn't recall seeing the book.

Considering all the evidence, I conclude that the most likely culprit is:

GUILTY: Louise Stubbs",Louise Stubbs,Katherine Tydings,93
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **Colonel Greenerbaum's alibi:** The colonel claimed that Malcolm scratched his car when he was in the kitchen doing the dishes. However, the colonel demonstrated the scratch by walking back to the house with the Porsche on his left side while holding the neck of the guitar in his left hand. This is a contradiction because if the colonel was in the kitchen, he couldn't have been walking back to the house with the Porsche on his left side. Therefore, the colonel's alibi is suspicious.

2. **Roxie's bike:** The colonel suggested that Roxie's bike could have caused the scratch. However, the scratch on the Porsche is parallel to the car and as straight as a ruler, which is unlikely to be caused by a bike with a splattered mud back tire. This makes Roxie's involvement less likely.

3. **Fido's leash:** The colonel pointed out that Fido's leash is the same height as the scratch. However, Fido is a dog, and his leash is attached to his collar, which is unlikely to cause a scratch as straight and long as the one on the Porsche.

4. **Malcolm's guitar:** The colonel demonstrated that Malcolm's guitar could have caused the scratch. However, Malcolm was carrying the guitar in his right hand when he came back to the house, not in his left hand, which contradicts the colonel's demonstration.

5. **The motion sensor light:** The motion sensor light turned itself off after its programmable delay period expired, and Fido's attempt to chase the cat turned it back on. This suggests that the light was not used by anyone, including the colonel, to inspect the scratch.

6. **Colonel Greenerbaum's behavior:** The colonel was grumpy and demanding throughout the evening, which suggests that he might be trying to manipulate the situation to his advantage.

Considering these points, the most suspicious person is **Colonel Greenerbaum**. His alibi is suspicious, and his behavior throughout the evening is aggressive and manipulative. The other suspects, Roxie and Malcolm, have some flaws in their alibis, but they don't seem as deliberate and manipulative as the colonel. Fido, being a dog, is unlikely to cause a scratch as straight and long as the one on the Porsche.

"To solve this mystery, I'll analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The thief is described as a relatively small man, wearing thick-soled boots that make him appear taller, and always wears a ski mask to conceal his identity. He carries a knife and gun.
2.  Eleanor, a former bank robber, is aware of the thief's modus operandi and notes that he is not overly greedy, indicating that he might not be motivated by financial gain alone.
3.  Eleanor suspects that the thief is one of the four boys who live nearby: Todd Summers, Jon Shaw, Max Reinke, or Zac Coulson.
4.  Todd Summers is described as the most violent and dangerous of the four, with a history of armed robbery and assault. However, Eleanor's past experience as a bank robber suggests that she might be more concerned with someone who is intelligent and calculating, rather than just violent.
5.  Jon Shaw is described as feeble-minded and stupid, which makes him less likely to be the intelligent and calculating thief that Eleanor is looking for.
6.  Max Reinke is described as a star basketball player who was headed to the state university on scholarship before getting into trouble due to alcohol. This suggests that Max might have had a promising future, but his involvement in crime might be a result of his own self-destruction rather than a deliberate attempt to commit crimes.
7.  Zac Coulson is described as a bully who picks on younger and smaller boys and teases little girls. However, Eleanor also notes that Zac is not smart enough to commit serious crimes on his own and is often in trouble because of his friends.
8.  When the thief returns, Eleanor is ready for him and confronts him with a pistol. The thief is shocked and scared, which suggests that he is not someone who is used to being confronted or intimidated.
9.  When Eleanor asks the thief to remove his mask, she is certain of his identity. However, the text does not explicitly state who the thief is, so we must infer based on the evidence.

Considering the evidence, I believe that the thief is likely Zac Coulson. Here's why:

*   Zac is described as a bully, which suggests that he might be more likely to take advantage of a vulnerable target like Eleanor, especially if he's with his friends.
*   Zac is also described as not being smart enough to commit serious crimes on his own, which suggests that he might be more likely to follow the lead of others, including the more intelligent and calculating Todd Summers.
*   However, Eleanor's past experience as a bank robber and her description of the thief as a ""punk"" suggest that she might be looking for someone who is less intelligent and more impulsive, which is consistent with Zac's behavior as a bully.
*   When Eleanor confronts the thief, she is certain of his identity, which suggests that she has made a connection between the thief's behavior and her knowledge of the neighborhood boys.

GUILTY: Zac Coulson",Zac Coulson,Zac Coulson,95
"To analyze the evidence and solve the mystery, I will break it down step by step:

1. **Ruth's statement**: Ruth states that she found a pool of pungent liquid on her kitchen counter, which she had tested and found to be arsenic. This implies that the killer must have been in a hurry and spilled the arsenic, which suggests that the killer was likely one of the ladies who was present at the dinner table.

2. **Mary's alibi**: Mary claims that she didn't have tea last week and never entered the kitchen. However, Ruth confirms that Mary didn't enter the kitchen last week, which means Mary's alibi checks out.

3. **Alice's statement**: Alice says she poured Ruth's tea, implying that she was in the kitchen with the tea. However, this doesn't necessarily mean she was the one who laced the tea with arsenic.

4. **Leona's behavior**: Leona reacts defensively when Ruth accuses her, which might suggest that she is guilty. However, it's also possible that she's just reacting to the accusation.

5. **Frances' alibi**: There is no mention of Frances being in the kitchen or handling the tea, so we can't directly link her to the crime.

6. **Ruth's keen observations**: Ruth observes everyone's movements and habits, including Alice's tea preferences and Leona's slovenly demeanor. This suggests that Ruth is a keen observer and might be trying to hide something.

7. **Ruth's actions**: When Ruth points her finger at the murderer and says ""Come out, Danny,"" it's clear that she's trying to mislead the suspects into thinking the police are waiting in the next room.

8. **The twist**: The fact that Lt. Danny Hoskins is in the next room with a uniformed officer waiting to arrest the murderer suggests that Ruth is trying to frame someone. Given Ruth's keen observations and her ability to manipulate the situation, it's likely that she is the one who laced the tea with arsenic.

**Reasoning**: Based on the evidence, I believe Ruth is the most likely suspect. Her keen observations, ability to manipulate the situation, and the fact that she's the one who found the arsenic in the kitchen all point to her guilt. The fact that she's trying to frame one of the other suspects by pointing at Danny also suggests that she's trying to cover her own tracks.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and replay the events of the evening in my mind.

1. **Eleanor's Forgetfulness**: The night started with Eleanor forgetting to put her diamond necklace in a safe place. This indicates that she might not have been paying close attention to her belongings.

2. **Colonel Barrow's Alibi**: When Colonel Barrow excused himself to visit the hall restroom, Fiona followed shortly thereafter. This could be a red herring, but it's worth noting.

3. **Fiona's Behavior**: Fiona wore a relatively inexpensive evening dress, which could indicate that she might not be as interested in expensive jewelry as the other guests. However, she did wear high heel shoes that Eleanor detested, which might suggest that Fiona was trying to make a statement.

4. **Abby's Necklace**: Abby wore her own diamond necklace, which suggests that she might not be interested in taking Eleanor's necklace. However, her eccentric behavior and wearing a skintight sleeveless evening gown might make her a suspect.

5. **Harold's Behavior**: Harold was one of Eleanor's favorites, and he was close to her all evening. This could suggest that he was in a good position to take the necklace without being noticed.

6. **Maurice's Behavior**: Maurice was Eleanor's caterer and friend, and he was nervous about working for her. This could suggest that he might be motivated to take the necklace to get back at Eleanor.

7. **The Timeline**: The necklace went missing after dinner, when everyone was in the living room. This suggests that the thief might have had a chance to take the necklace when Eleanor was distracted by the group.

Now, let's replay the events of the evening in my mind:

* Eleanor forgets the necklace on her bed.
* The guests arrive, and everyone is in the living room.
* Colonel Barrow and Fiona visit the restroom, but they don't seem to be in a good position to take the necklace.
* Harold retrieves ice from the kitchen, but he doesn't seem to have a motive.
* Maurice serves dinner and is nervous, but he doesn't seem to be in a good position to take the necklace.
* Abby excused herself briefly to suppress a sneezing fit, but Eleanor can't recall where she went.

However, when I re-examine the evidence, I notice that **Fiona's behavior is suspicious**. She wore high heel shoes that Eleanor detested, which might suggest that Fiona was trying to make a statement. Additionally, Fiona was one of the first people to arrive at the apartment, and she was in the hall closet when Eleanor took her jacket and purse. This could suggest that Fiona had access to the bedroom where the necklace was left.

Furthermore, when I re-examine the timeline, I notice that **Fiona was in a good position to take the necklace**. She was one of the first people to arrive, and she was in the hall closet when Eleanor took her jacket and purse. This could suggest that Fiona had access to the bedroom where the necklace was left.

"To solve this mystery, I'll carefully analyze the clues provided in the poem.

1. The poem mentions that the fake painting is a replica with ""some tainting of the true artist's real painting."" This indicates that the fake painting is not a perfect copy, but rather a modified or altered version.
2. The poem also states that the fake painting ""said things that weren't true!"" This implies that the fake painting is telling lies or spreading misinformation.
3. The poem mentions that the presidents discussed various historical events and their experiences, but one of them stood out as being dishonest. The presidents mentioned include:
	* Bill Clinton's wife trying to be president in 2008 (true)
	* Nixon's moon landing (true)
	* Truman's loss in the 1948 election (true)
	* Ford's election as president (true)
	* Harrison's short term as president (true)
	* Jefferson's purchases of Louisiana (true)
4. The poem then reveals that the fake painting is hiding in plain sight, and it's not one of the presidents who spoke about their true experiences. The clue is given by Obama, who says that he knows the original painting has been taken and replaced with a new one, which is the fake painting.
5. The poem then states that the fake painting is hanging by the teacher's chair, but it's not specified which president's painting is the fake. However, it's implied that the fake painting is one of the suspects.
6. To narrow down the suspects, I'll analyze the quotes from the presidents:
	* George Bush: He talks about his father and son being president, which is true.
	* Gerald Ford: He talks about being elected president, which is true.
	* John Quincy Adams: He talks about being a president and having a cousin who was also president, which is true.
	* Richard Nixon: He talks about sending men to the moon and being elected, which is partially true. However, he also mentions his slogan ""Nixon's the one!"" and claims he won after losing, which is not entirely accurate. He lost the 1960 election to Kennedy and was not re-elected in 1972.
7. Based on the analysis, the quote that stands out as being dishonest is Nixon's claim of winning after losing. This implies that Nixon is the fake painting, and he's the one telling lies.

"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The ornament left for the children is a White House ornament with a scene of the Hay-Adams Hotel. However, there is a horse-drawn carriage in the scene. This suggests that the president who left the ornament stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel before moving into the White House.

2.  The ornament has a hidden compartment with a scene of the Statue of Liberty. The scene includes a ship with soldiers on the deck, one of whom is wearing a spiked helmet and a tricolor flag. This detail is significant, as it suggests a specific historical event.

3.  The president who left the ornament must have been in office before the construction of the White House was completed, as they mention a ""picture window"" at the Hay-Adams Hotel, implying that they had a view of the White House during its construction.

4.  The ornament's scene of the Statue of Liberty suggests that the president who left it was in office during a time when the Statue of Liberty was not yet built. The Statue of Liberty was dedicated in 1886, and the White House was completed in 1800.

5.  Considering these clues, let's examine the suspects:

   *   Andrew Jackson was president from 1829 to 1837. He would not have stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel, as it was not built until the late 19th century.
   *   John Adams was president from 1797 to 1801. He would have stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel before moving into the White House, as it was during his presidency that the White House was being built.
   *   William Howard Taft was president from 1909 to 1913. He would not have stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel, as it was not built until the late 19th century.
   *   Calvin Coolidge was president from 1923 to 1929. He would not have stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel, as it was not built until the late 19th century.

6.  Based on the evidence, John Adams is the only suspect who matches the criteria. He was president before the White House was completed, and he would have stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel before moving into the White House. The ornament's scene of the Statue of Liberty, which was not yet built during his presidency, suggests that he was aware of its construction and wanted to leave a hint about it for the children.

"To analyze the evidence and determine the location of Uncle Robert's grave, I will break down the information provided in the story.

1.  Grave no. 1 is located in the oldest section of the cemetery, farthest from the church, with the oldest graves (1843). This area is the first section to be filled up, which could indicate that the cemetery was organized chronologically.
2.  Grave no. 2 is not in a specific location that stands out, but it is surrounded by marked graves of families, indicating that this section of the cemetery may not be organized chronologically.
3.  Grave no. 3 is between markers of a man (Nelson) who died in 1860 and a woman (Nolan) who died of tuberculosis in 1872. The markers in this section are in alphabetical order, which suggests that this section was organized by name rather than chronology.
4.  Grave no. 4 is located in the area of the cemetery occupied by persons of prominence, such as government officials, pastors, and a U.S. Senator.
5.  Grave no. 5 is in the Orphan's Corner, an area with graves of children, teenagers, and younger individuals.

Gary Patrick notes that his great-aunt Lucille is buried in the cemetery, and all the graves around hers are marked, but none of them is her husband Robert's. This suggests that Robert's grave may be in a location that is not directly adjacent to Lucille's.

Considering the above information, we can make some educated guesses about the possible locations of Robert's grave:

-  Since the section of the cemetery with the oldest graves is organized chronologically (Grave no. 1), it's unlikely that Robert's grave would be located there, given that he died in 1905, which is much later than the earliest graves in that section.
-  The section with Grave no. 2 does not have a distinct characteristic that would make it stand out as the most likely location for Robert's grave.
-  The section with Grave no. 3 is organized alphabetically, which could be a possibility, but it's also not the most likely location given the information about Lucille's grave and the fact that Robert's name is not among the marked graves in that section.
-  The section with Grave no. 4 is occupied by prominent individuals, which might suggest that Robert's grave could be in a location of honor, but it's not the most likely location given the context of the story.
-  The Orphan's Corner (Grave no. 5) is a unique section of the cemetery, and the fact that it's located near the gate could suggest that it's a more recent addition to the cemetery. Given that Robert died in 1905, it's possible that his grave was buried in this section, especially considering the fact that the Orphan's Corner is an area with graves of children, teenagers, and younger individuals, which could be a reflection of the fact that Robert and his wife Lucille lost everything during the War Between the States and had to rebuild their lives.

However, the most significant clue in the story is the fact that April Park, one of Gary's star pupils, is able to guess the location of Robert's grave after hearing the story. This suggests that the solution to the mystery is not as complex as it initially seems, and that there is a logical explanation for the location of Robert's grave.

Given the information and the clue about April Park's ability to guess the location of Robert's grave, I believe that the most logical conclusion is that Grave no. 5, located in the Orphan's Corner, is the most likely location of Robert's grave.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence provided and break down the reasoning step by step.

**Step 1: Eliminate impossible scenarios**

First, let's consider what we know about the vault and the challenge. The item can be anything that fits in a 4x6 inch box, and the person placing the item must leave their name on a piece of paper with it. This means that the item must be small enough to fit in the box, and the person placing it must be able to write their name on a piece of paper.

**Step 2: Analyze each suspect's activities**

Now, let's examine each suspect's activities on the days they visited the vault:

* **Edward Frates (Tuesday)**: Carried a big duffel bag into the vault and left with only a pencil. This suggests that he might have stored something large in the vault, which is unlikely to fit in a 4x6 inch box.
* **James Madigan (Wednesday)**: Entered the vault with a client, but Robert took his eye off the vault for a few moments, so we can't be sure what James did in there.
* **Peter Zielny (Tuesday and Thursday)**: Entered the vault with a client on Tuesday, and Robert can't see what Peter does in the vault. On Thursday, Peter entered the vault with Russell, but Robert didn't see what Peter did in there either.
* **Ronald Finch (Thursday)**: Entered the vault alone, shortly before closing time. He was in there for a long time, but finally exited a few minutes after closing time.
* **Russell Winwood (Thursday)**: Entered the vault with Jane, his administrative assistant, and then left alone. He was carrying a briefcase, which might contain the item.

**Step 3: Look for inconsistencies and clues**

Now, let's look for inconsistencies and clues that might help us solve the mystery:

* **Duffel bag**: Edward's duffel bag is a red flag. It's unlikely that he could fit something small enough in a 4x6 inch box in a duffel bag.
* **Long time in the vault**: Ronald was in the vault for a long time, but this doesn't necessarily mean he's guilty. However, it does suggest that he might have been doing something that took some time, like storing something large.
* **Briefcase**: Russell carried a briefcase into the vault, which could contain the item. However, we don't know what's in the briefcase.
* **Client in the vault**: Peter entered the vault with a client on Tuesday, but Robert can't see what Peter does in there. This is a possible clue, but we need more information.

**Step 4: Make a conclusion**

Based on the evidence, I think the most likely suspect is **Russell Winwood**. Here's why:

* Russell carried a briefcase into the vault, which could contain the item.
* He entered the vault with Jane, but then left alone, which suggests that he might have placed the item in the vault after Jane left.
* We don't know what's in the briefcase, but it's a plausible way to transport a small item.
* The other suspects have more suspicious activities (Edward's duffel bag, James's unclear activity, Peter's inability to be seen, and Ronald's long time in the vault), but Russell's briefcase is a more straightforward explanation for how the item could have been placed in the vault.

1. **Joe the janitor**: Joe claims that he was trying to scare us, but the evidence suggests that he might be telling the truth. He has a set of keys to the entire building, including the rent box, which makes him a prime suspect. However, he also seems genuinely concerned about being suspected of stealing the rent money. He even offers us a deal to find the money before the manager arrives, which suggests that he's not trying to cover up his own crime.

2. **Larry**: Larry is hiding in the closet and seems evasive when questioned by Mr. Jorgensen about his whereabouts. He also lies about paying Mr. Jorgensen back the $500 he borrowed. However, Larry's alibi for the time of the theft is shaky at best, and he seems to be trying to deflect attention from himself.

3. **Mr. Jorgensen**: Mr. Jorgensen has a suspicious alibi, claiming to have been on a trip to Hawaii, but Larry catches him in a lie when he reveals that he has a red silk Hawaiian shirt poking out from under his sweater. This suggests that Mr. Jorgensen was not on a trip at all. However, there's no concrete evidence linking him to the theft.

4. **The building manager**: The building manager is angry and accusatory towards Larry and me, but his anger seems genuine. He has a motive to blame someone for the theft, as it reflects poorly on him. However, his accusation of us is based on circumstantial evidence, and he doesn't seem to have a solid alibi.

After analyzing the evidence, I notice that Larry's behavior is suspicious. He's hiding in the closet, lying about his whereabouts, and seems evasive when questioned. Additionally, his alibi for the time of the theft is shaky at best. Considering these points, I believe that Larry is the most likely culprit.

"To analyze the evidence and determine the guilty party, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Letter from Roscoe**: The letter accuses one of the Boyles children of poisoning Aunt Ethel. It's unclear if Roscoe is a credible source, but it's a starting point.

2. **Investigation at the scene**: The children remember the events of the July Fourth pool party. They recall who arrived first, who was present, and what they did. They also remember the condiment tray and the spoiled salad dressing bottle.

3. **Timeline and Alibis**:
   - George was the first to arrive and was already in the pool when the others arrived. He gashed his finger on the intake grill and spent the rest of the day with a bandage on his hand. This alibi seems solid.
   - Patrick arrived with his wife and their daughter Alice. He was with his family and didn't go into the kitchen. His alibi is also strong.
   - Trish arrived through the backyard gate and never entered the kitchen. She was with Roscoe and Ethel when they arrived and later with John. Her alibi is solid.
   - Dennis arrived with his family and was in the pool until it was time to eat. His alibi is strong as well.
   - John was frying hamburgers outside and later saw Roscoe and Ethel speaking with Trish. He also saw them later when they went over to the pool area. His alibi is solid.

4. **Salad Dressing Bottle**: The bottle was sealed with the top screwed on when Patrick and Trish saw it in the kitchen. This suggests that the bottle was tampered with before it was put out on the condiment tray.

5. **George's Statement**: George mentioned that Aunt Ethel was not a nice person and that ""you saying one of us paid her back?"" suggests he might be considering the possibility that one of them might have committed the crime.

6. **Additional Evidence**: There's no other concrete evidence pointing to any of the siblings. No one saw anyone handling the salad dressing, and no one has any clear motive for the crime.

Given the information and alibis, it's difficult to pinpoint the guilty party solely based on the evidence. However, let's examine the statement made by the voice at the end: ""Looking at the guilty sibling, the voice said, 'I know you did this. Would you like to tell the rest of us why?'""

The voice could be any of the siblings, but the statement suggests that the voice is directly pointing at one of the siblings. Considering the alibis and the fact that George was the first to arrive and was already in the pool when the others arrived, it's unlikely he was the one who handled the salad dressing.

However, there is a crucial piece of information that can be inferred from the statement made by Trish: ""I would bet that Roscoe saw somebody handle the salad dressing and later put two and two together."" This statement suggests that Trish thinks Roscoe saw someone else handling the salad dressing.

Considering the timeline and the alibis, it's unlikely that John or Dennis handled the salad dressing. They both have solid alibis. Patrick's alibi is also strong, and he was with his family the entire time.

Given the information and the statement made by Trish, it's likely that the voice is pointing at **George**. However, the evidence doesn't explicitly point to George as the guilty party. The statement made by the voice at the end could be a clever ruse to distract from the actual guilty party.

Considering the evidence and the alibis, it's difficult to pinpoint the guilty party with certainty. However, based on the statement made by the voice at the end, I'll take a chance and say:

1. **The noises in the night**: Ernestine heard noises in the night, which she initially attributed to her husband's ghost. However, on the night of her birthday, the noises were different - she heard the creaking of a door, heavy footsteps, and the clicking of metal on metal. This suggests that the noises were not caused by a ghost, but rather by someone who was physically present in the house.

2. **The empty safe**: In the morning, Ernestine discovered that the wall safe was empty. This indicates that the gold coins were indeed stolen.

3. **Casey's suspicious behavior**: Casey arrived at the house wearing only a tank top, baggy military fatigue trousers, and heavy-soled boots. He also brought a small plastic bag with a change of socks and underwear. This suggests that he was prepared to leave the house at a moment's notice, which could be consistent with someone who planned to steal something and leave the house without being detected.

4. **Ellen's agility and stealth**: Ellen is described as a ballet dancer who is able to appear and disappear unnoticed. While this could be a coincidence, it's also a skill that could be useful for someone who wants to steal something without being detected.

5. **Connie's mobility issues**: Connie has a shorter leg and walks unevenly with the help of a cane and an elevated shoe. This would make it difficult for her to move around the house quietly and quickly, which could be a problem for someone who wants to steal something without being detected.

6. **Michael's health**: Michael is 65 years old, overweight, and has emphysema, which would make it difficult for him to move around the house without being heard. He also mentioned that he can't see well in the dark, even with his thick glasses.

Considering these points, the most suspicious person is **Casey McCormick**. His preparation to leave the house with only a small bag, his ability to move around the house without being detected, and the fact that he was the only one who didn't have a clear alibi for the time the theft occurred make him the most likely suspect.

2. **The Secret Friend**: Fred mentions that one of his friends has the other key and was Sarah's secret friend. This person gave her comfort during her last few weeks of life and performed some unusual actions after her death.

3. **Unusual Actions**: These actions include leaving messages in Sarah's room, such as a cigarette lighter, a piece of tissue paper, and a Robert's Book Store business card. The messages were written in an awkward script, which could be a clue.

4. **Alibis and Smoking Habits**: Fred and his wife noticed the key missing a month before Sarah passed away, and she mentioned giving it to one of her friends. The friends traded house keys, making it easy for them to enter each other's homes.

5. **Questioning the Friends**: Fred asks each friend about the key and their alibis.

- Bill Baker is a smoker but uses matches and claims he's not Sarah's secret friend.
- Harold Coker denies being Sarah's secret friend but admits to having been a smoker in the past.
- Lyn Baker didn't know about the key to the Cokers' house and didn't know that they traded house keys.

6. **Analysis of the Evidence**:
   - Bill Baker is a smoker, but he uses matches, not a cigarette lighter.
   - Harold Coker was a smoker in the past and fits the description of the person who left the messages in Sarah's room (cigarette lighter, tissue paper, and business card).
   - Lyn Baker's alibi about not knowing about the key to the Cokers' house and not trading house keys is suspicious, but it's not enough to eliminate her as a suspect.

7. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the person who fits the description of the secret friend is Harold Coker. He was a smoker in the past, and his actions match the unusual messages left in Sarah's room. The fact that he was a smoker and admitted to it in the past makes him the most likely suspect.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Analyzing the journal entries**: Each entry describes a different location where the treasure is supposedly hidden. To determine which entry is true, we need to look for inconsistencies or contradictions that can help us narrow down the options.

2. **Examining Wilbur's entry**: Wilbur's entry mentions that he stole gold from a Union payroll train in Elmira, New York, and hid it in the back pasture under a flat tombstone. However, this entry is dated January 23, 1871, which is more than a year after the war ended. This raises suspicions, as it seems unlikely that Wilbur would have been able to steal from a Union payroll train after the war was over.

3. **Examining Susie's entry**: Susie's entry mentions that Wilbur stole a gold spike from the transcontinental railroad and hid it in the upper loft of the round barn. This entry is dated July 4, 1889, which is about 20 years after the transcontinental railroad was completed. This raises suspicions, as it seems unlikely that Wilbur would have been involved in stealing a gold spike 20 years after the railroad was completed.

4. **Examining Leonard's entry**: Leonard's entry mentions that Victor helped him move a chest of silver nuggets to a new hiding place in the basement closet. However, this entry is dated June 12, 1919, which is after Leonard's father, Wilbur, had passed away. This raises suspicions, as it seems unlikely that Leonard would be hiding a treasure that his father had already passed away.

5. **Examining Victor's entry**: Victor's entry mentions that his father, Wilbur, hid stocks and bonds in the wall behind the ice box in the kitchen. However, this entry is dated March 3, 1925, which is after Victor's father had passed away. This raises suspicions, as it seems unlikely that Victor would be hiding a treasure that his father had already passed away.

6. **Examining Edith's entry**: Edith's entry mentions that her grandfather, Wilbur, hid a box of bills in the old wash room. This entry is dated January 31, 1936, which is after Wilbur had passed away. However, this entry is the only one that mentions a specific location (the old wash room) that has not been mentioned in any other entry.

7. **Analyzing the inconsistencies**: Based on the analysis above, we can see that all the entries have inconsistencies and contradictions. However, Edith's entry is the only one that does not mention a location that has been mentioned in any other entry. This suggests that Edith's entry may be the most plausible one.

8. **Conclusion**: Based on the analysis above, I believe that the guilty person is the one who wrote the entry that is most likely to be true. In this case, I believe that the guilty person is Edith, as her entry is the only one that does not have any obvious inconsistencies or contradictions.

"Let's break down the evidence step by step:

1. **Cause of Death:** Miser Cartright died from an overdose of his heart medicine. However, he had been given a new prescription with a stronger dosage, which suggests that he might have intentionally taken more medication than prescribed.

2. **Prescription Filling:** Moira, his housekeeper, was responsible for picking up his prescription for him. This could imply that she had the opportunity to alter the prescription or ensure that he took more medication than intended.

3. **New Will:** Miser Cartright's new will, which he wrote on Christmas Eve, left his house and a trust fund to his son, Jonathan, and made significant donations to the local hospital. This change in his will suggests that he might have been feeling remorseful or wanting to make amends for his past behavior.

4. **Letter to Jonathan:** The letter, which Miser Cartright wrote to his son, shows a change in his attitude and a desire to make amends. However, the fact that the letter was unsigned and not delivered to Jonathan until after Miser Cartright's death raises suspicions.

5. **Moira's Reaction:** Moira seems genuinely surprised and happy about the new will, which suggests that she might not have been aware of the changes Miser Cartright made.

6. **Jonathan's Reaction:** Jonathan seems uncomfortable and guilty about his father's death, but he claims not to have known about the change in the will.

7. **Dr. Gilchrest's Role:** Dr. Gilchrest is mentioned as the one who gave Miser Cartright the new prescription. However, there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in Miser Cartright's death.

Given these points, let's analyze the suspects:

- **Dr. Gilchrest:** There is no direct evidence linking Dr. Gilchrest to Miser Cartright's death. He is simply the one who gave him the new prescription.

- **Miser James Cartright (suicide):** While Miser Cartright's change in behavior and attitude in the letter to his son suggest that he might have been feeling remorseful, the fact that he wrote the letter and made significant changes to his will on Christmas Eve, and then died on Christmas Day, raises suspicions. However, the possibility of suicide cannot be ruled out entirely.

- **Moira Laurie:** Moira had the opportunity to alter the prescription or ensure that Miser Cartright took more medication than intended. Her reaction to the new will seems genuine, but it's possible that she was trying to cover her tracks.

- **Jonathan Cartright:** Jonathan's reaction to his father's death and the new will seems suspicious. He claims not to have known about the change in the will, but it's possible that he was aware of it and wanted to avoid any potential inheritance.

Based on the analysis, I would say that the most suspicious person is **Moira Laurie**. Her opportunity to alter the prescription, combined with her reaction to the new will, raises suspicions. However, it's essential to note that the evidence is circumstantial, and more investigation would be needed to confirm her guilt.

GUILTY: Moira Laurie",Moira Laurie,Moira Laurie,107
"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step:

1. Countess Mannerley claims that she had her necklace stolen after she danced with Robert Bannington and then went to powder her nose. However, she mentioned that she had previously danced with Archibald Hopkins, and they had a brief dance. This suggests that she may have had a motive to steal the necklace, as she had already danced with Hopkins and was trying to keep their past relationship a secret.

2. When I asked Countess Mannerley about her past, she revealed that she had a history with Archibald Hopkins, who was a fence in London. This implies that she may have been involved in theft in the past, and it's possible that she stole the necklace to cover up her past.

3. Countess Mannerley also mentioned that she hadn't insured the necklace, which suggests that she may have been trying to avoid being caught, as she wouldn't have to pay for the insurance.

4. Robert Bannington, on the other hand, provided an alibi for the time the necklace was stolen. He said that he was dancing with Countess Mannerley and then went to meet another lady. His alibi checks out with Loralie Courtney's statement, as she mentioned that she saw Countess Mannerley's pearls and was talking about them with her.

5. Archibald Hopkins also provided an alibi for the time the necklace was stolen. He said that he had a brief dance with Countess Mannerley and then sat down due to his gout. However, it's worth noting that he was trying to hide his past relationship with Countess Mannerley, which raises some suspicions.

6. Loralie Courtney's statement seems to be the most innocent, as she was talking to Countess Mannerley about the necklace and didn't seem to have any motive to steal it.

Considering the evidence, the most suspicious person is Countess Mannerley. She had a motive to steal the necklace (to cover up her past), and her alibi is shaky. The fact that she fainted when she saw that her necklace was missing also suggests that she was trying to create a distraction.

GUILTY: Countess Mannerley",Countess Mannerley,Robert Bannington,108
"Let's analyze the evidence carefully.

1. Aly, the single girl among the older kids, was on the other side of the sand dune with one of the boys at midnight. This suggests that the kiss happened between Aly and one of the boys.
2. Aly refused to tell Tom who the boy was, but she did admit to kissing him.
3. Tom was concerned about the boys kissing Aly, so he checked the house for mistletoe and made sure she was downstairs with the other kids before he left for the fireworks.
4. The fact that Aly's mom, Diane, already knew who the boy was suggests that she might have some insight or evidence that Tom doesn't have.
5. The other kids were all distracted by the cookies, and Jeremy's face was covered in chocolate, which suggests that he might have been too busy eating cookies to pay attention to what Aly was doing.
6. Reese and Danny were both competing to see who could win on the ping-pong and pool tables, respectively, and they were both focused on their games.

Considering these points, let's look at the behavior of each suspect:

* Danny: He was focused on winning on the ping-pong table and didn't seem to be paying attention to Aly.
* Jeremy: He was too busy eating cookies to pay attention to Aly.
* Reese: He was also focused on winning on the pool table, but he was a bit more likely to be distracted by the other kids, especially since he was competing with Danny.
* RJ: There is no information about RJ's behavior or activities during the New Year's Eve party, which makes it difficult to determine his involvement.

Based on the evidence, I'm going to make an educated guess that the guilty person is...

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to solve the mystery.

**Step 1: Review the timeline and identify potential motives**

- The party started at 7:00 p.m. and the first clue was dropped around 7:15 p.m. (when Mary Beth tripped and spilled brandy).
- Blake died about 10 minutes later, around 7:25 p.m.
- The suspects are Juanita Wade, Mary Beth Sloan, Noel King, Roy Wade, and Theresa King.

**Step 2: Identify the key events and potential clues**

- Mary Beth tripped and spilled brandy, but the cap was still on the decanter.
- The telephone rang, and Mary Beth answered it in the kitchen.
- A loud noise came from upstairs, and Roy went to investigate.
- Juanita and Roy went upstairs together.
- Mary Beth fainted in the kitchen, and Noel and Theresa went to help her.
- Blake died after drinking from the decanter, which still had its cap on.

**Step 3: Analyze the brandy decanter and the timing**

- The decanter was capped before Blake answered the door, and the cap was still on when he died.
- This means that the poison was added to the decanter before 7:15 p.m., when Mary Beth spilled brandy.
- The killer had to be present in the den before 7:15 p.m. to add the poison.

**Step 4: Eliminate suspects based on the timeline and evidence**

- Roy Wade was upstairs when the noise occurred and didn't return until after Blake died. He couldn't have added the poison to the decanter.
- Juanita Wade went upstairs with Roy and was also absent from the den before 7:15 p.m.
- Noel King was in the den with the Wades when the noise occurred and didn't leave until after Blake died.
- Theresa King was with Noel in the den and didn't leave until after Blake died.

**Step 5: Identify the killer**

- The only person who was alone in the den before 7:15 p.m. was Mary Beth Sloan.
- She was the one who spilled brandy, but the cap was still on the decanter, suggesting that she might have added the poison before that.
- Mary Beth had the opportunity and motive to kill Blake, as she was the one who planned the party and was likely frustrated with Blake's dominance over the planning process.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the evidence and the timeline, the killer is:

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **The kitten's presence in the garage**: The kitten is found in a new animal carrying case in the garage, which suggests that someone must have brought it there and placed it there before the family went outside to search for it.

2. **The lack of tracks leading to the garage**: When the family went outside, they found huge overshoe tracks leading to the garage door, but no tracks were present when Dad came home an hour ago. This implies that the person who brought the kitten must have arrived after Dad came home.

3. **Dad's asthma**: Dad has an asthma attack when he spends more than a few seconds in cold weather, and he uses an inhaler to relieve his symptoms. This is a crucial piece of information because it explains why Dad couldn't have brought the kitten to the garage.

4. **The condition of Melchoir's slippers**: Melchoir's slippers are still wet from the snow, which suggests that he was outside recently. This is consistent with the fact that he was the last person to stay on the covered porch while the others went outside to search for the kitten.

5. **The opportunity to bring the kitten**: Melchoir was the only one who didn't go outside with the others to search for the kitten. He was left on the covered porch, which would have given him the opportunity to bring the kitten to the garage.

Considering these points, the evidence suggests that Melchoir was the one who brought the kitten to the garage and placed it in the carrying case. Therefore:

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who is guilty.

1. **Initial Investigation**: The investigation begins with King Ted accusing someone of taking Princess Boo's candy. He sees footprints by the water and announces an investigation.

2. **Search by the Animals**: The animals, including Pride the horse, Rupert the cat, and Lancelot the fox, search for clues. Pride and Rupert search together, but Lancelot is cooking dinner when they stumble upon him.

3. **Initial Suspicions**: Pride and Rupert initially suspect Lancelot, but Lancelot is innocent. He was cooking dinner, and the accident involving Pride and Rupert just made a mess.

4. **New Theory**: Pride starts to think that the search for the candy might be a game, and King Ted might have hidden the treasure for his own pleasure. However, Rupert thinks that Lancelot might be the one who took the candy, as he is a skilled cook and might have a motive to steal the candy.

5. **New Clues**: When the animals are searching, Pride and Rupert don't find any direct evidence, but they do stumble upon Lancelot's cooking, which might have been a distraction.

6. **Princess Boo's Investigation**: Princess Boo decides to investigate on her own and reviews the evidence collected by the animals. She studies the details and announces her findings.

7. **Boo's Conclusion**: Boo reveals that the candy crook is... (wait for it)... **Rupert the cat**!

My reasoning is as follows:

* Rupert was initially suspicious of Lancelot, but Lancelot's alibi checks out.
* Rupert was the one who was covered in Lancelot's stew, which might have been a distraction.
* Rupert was involved in the search, but he didn't find any direct evidence.
* Boo reviews the evidence and finds the key to solving the mystery.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. The scene takes place on Christmas Eve, and the group of pickpockets, led by Fagin, are out on the streets to practice their thieving skills. They have a system where they work together to steal wallets and purses, with Nancy often distracting the victims while The Artful Dodger or Oliver Twist performs the actual theft.

2. On the specific night of the incident, the group targets a rich gentleman outside Rule's Restaurant. The Artful Dodger and Oliver approach the gentleman, while Nancy and Fagin approach from the opposite direction. However, the gentleman unexpectedly looks up and seems to recognize Oliver, whom he believes to be his long-lost grandson.

3. The gentleman grabs Oliver by the wrists, and Fagin flees the scene, coughing nervously. Nancy continues walking down the street without making contact with Oliver or the gentleman.

4. A London policeman is posted outside the restaurant and takes Oliver into custody, suspecting that he might be the victim of a crime. However, when questioned, the gentleman reveals that he believes Oliver to be his long-lost grandson, and that he is the victim of an attempted theft.

5. Sergeant Cuff at Police Headquarters is amused by the situation and mentions that he has been following the gang, but three members (Fagin, Nancy, and The Artful Dodger) have disappeared, leaving Oliver behind.

Now, let's analyze the evidence to determine who is guilty:

- Fagin is a key figure in the group of pickpockets and is known to be a master thief. He flees the scene when the gentleman grabs Oliver, which suggests that he might be involved in the attempted theft. However, his nervous cough and hasty departure could also imply that he is trying to avoid detection.

- Nancy is also a member of the group and is often involved in distracting victims. She continues walking down the street without making contact with Oliver or the gentleman, which could suggest that she is not involved in the attempted theft.

- Oliver Twist is the latest recruit to the group and has been practicing his pickpocketing skills. However, he is unexpectedly recognized by the gentleman as his long-lost grandson, which seems unlikely given the context of the story.

- The Artful Dodger is a skilled thief and is involved in the attempted theft. However, he is not the one who flees the scene when the gentleman grabs Oliver.

- The Rich Gentleman is the victim of the attempted theft, but he is not the one committing the crime.

Considering the evidence, it seems that Fagin is the most likely suspect. He is the leader of the group, and his hasty departure from the scene suggests that he might be trying to avoid detection. However, there is no concrete evidence that directly links him to the attempted theft.

However, when the gentleman says, ""if you can tell me who has my watch, I will make sure that you have the finest Christmas dinner you’ve ever enjoyed!"" the watch is clearly the property of the rich gentleman, which implies that it has been stolen. However, the thief had not had time to steal the watch, and the rich gentleman already has it. This implies that he is not a victim, and it was Oliver who had been holding the watch.

The Artful Dodger was the one who had planned to steal the watch, and Oliver was holding it. This implies that Oliver was not a victim, but a participant in the crime. The Artful Dodger and Fagin were not present when the watch was discovered, which implies that they were not the ones who had taken it. Nancy was also not present, which implies that she was not the one who had taken it.

Given this new information, it is clear that Oliver Twist was involved in the crime. He had been practicing his pickpocketing skills with Fagin's group, and he was holding the watch when it was discovered. This implies that he was the one who had stolen the watch.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who the Secret Santa is.

1.  Pastor Dan observed that the gifts were being placed quickly and silently, suggesting that the person is agile and has no mobility issues.
2.  The gifts were placed in the sanctuary, which is a large room that requires some effort to carry gifts, suggesting that the person is physically capable of lifting and carrying heavy loads.
3.  The person uses their left hand to reach into the sack of gifts, which is an interesting detail.
4.  Pastor Dan eliminated Al Busby as a suspect because he suffers from arthritic knees and walks with a cane, which would make it difficult for him to move quickly and silently.
5.  Pastor Dan also considered Chuck Daughtry, but he had broken his arm a couple of weeks ago and may still be recovering from the injury, which would limit his ability to carry heavy loads or move quickly.
6.  Bob Key, or Bobby, is described as being lovable and clumsy, and he has broken a leg and a lamp recently, which suggests that he may not be the most agile person.
7.  Jim Dockery, on the other hand, is described as a former professional baseball player who was the first left-handed pitcher to throw a no-hitter in his minor league team. This suggests that he has a strong and agile left arm, which would be useful for reaching into a sack of gifts with his left hand.
8.  Finally, Pastor Dan considered Jeff Reynolds, but he has a limp and lost strength on his right side due to a minor stroke, which would make it difficult for him to carry heavy loads or move quickly.

Considering all these details, the evidence points to Jim Dockery as the most likely suspect. He has the physical ability to carry heavy loads, move quickly and silently, and use his left hand to reach into the sack of gifts. The fact that he is a former professional baseball player also suggests that he has the physical dexterity and coordination to perform the tasks required of Secret Santa.

"Let's break down the evidence and analyze it step by step.

1. **Evidence from the scene:**
   - The cash register was located behind Santa's chair, and the thief had to be someone who works for the mall.
   - Only Mr. Corrigan, the photographer, and Santa had a key to the register.
   - The photographer claimed to have only taken pictures of 18 kids, but there were more children than that in the scene.

2. **Alibis:**
   - Mr. Corrigan was worried about the mall's finances and had invited a banker to visit. He seemed genuinely concerned about the store's earnings.
   - Santa Claus was seated and couldn't leave his chair due to the mall's rule. He also didn't have a clear opportunity to steal the money.
   - The photographer was too busy taking pictures and seemed annoyed when questioned by the elves.

3. **Clues:**
   - The photographer had used several dozen rolls of film, but claimed to have only taken pictures of 18 kids. This suggests that he might have been taking pictures of something else, possibly the cash register.
   - The photographer's behavior seemed suspicious, and he seemed irritated when questioned by the elves.
   - The cash register was located on the photographer's table, and he was the one handling the money.

4. **Motives:**
   - Mr. Corrigan wanted the insurance company to reimburse him for the stolen money, which could be a motive for him to stage the theft.
   - Santa didn't have a clear motive, and his alibi seemed solid.
   - Mrs. Martin was worried about the theft and was cooperative with the investigation.

5. **Conclusion:**
   Based on the evidence, alibis, clues, and motives, the most likely suspect is the photographer. He had access to the cash register, seemed suspicious, and had a clear opportunity to stage the theft. The fact that he used more film than he claimed to have taken pictures of children suggests that he might have been taking pictures of the cash register or the money being taken. His irritated behavior when questioned by the elves also suggests that he might be hiding something.

"To determine who is guilty, I will carefully analyze the evidence presented in the mystery story.

Step 1: Analyze the flight route and the behavior of the suspects

The Flying Bandit took off from Long Island, flew to Liverpool, and lost the knapsack of money approximately 5 hours into his getaway flight. The police have identified four suspects trying to leave the country, and they all match the general description of the Flying Bandit. Let's examine their alibis:

- David Loftkiss was stopped by the Southampton constabulary trying to board the SS United States bound for New York City. He claims to be afraid of flying and prefers ocean liners. However, in 1957, air travel is relatively safe, and his fear of flying seems unusual.

- Cliff Snelling was attempting to board a ferry at Holyhead, bound for Dublin, Ireland. He claims to be commissioned to paint horses at Lord Harding's Irish estate. However, this alibi seems suspicious, as he's trying to retrace the original flight path after the robbery.

- Tom Jenks was picked up at Heathrow Airport, and he claims to be on his way to Gander, Newfoundland. He seems agitated and claims to be suing the police for false arrest.

- Clem Duster was stopped at an airfield and had a flight plan to Iceland. He claims to be renting a plane for a pleasure flight to visit a woman he met at a beauty pageant.

Step 2: Analyze the inconsistencies and suspicious behavior of the suspects

Upon closer examination, Clem Duster's alibi seems the most suspicious. He was renting a plane and had a flight plan to Iceland, which seems like an unusual destination for a pleasure flight. He also claims to have met a woman named Miss Iceland at a beauty pageant, which seems like a convenient excuse.

Step 3: Analyze the evidence and make a conclusion

The Flying Bandit lost the knapsack of money approximately 5 hours into his getaway flight. The police have identified four suspects trying to leave the country, and Clem Duster's alibi seems the most suspicious. He was renting a plane and had a flight plan to Iceland, which seems like an unusual destination for a pleasure flight. His story about meeting a woman named Miss Iceland at a beauty pageant also seems like a convenient excuse.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that Clem Duster is the most likely suspect. His alibi seems suspicious, and he had a flight plan to Iceland, which is a long way from the destination of his pleasure flight.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence step by step.

Step 1: Analyze the initial claim of the forgery
The victim, Sheila Ingalls, claims that her engagement announcement was forged and replaced with an announcement of her fiancé, Wallace Anders, being engaged to Georgette Pelham. This is the central mystery we need to solve.

Step 2: Examine the method of posting the announcements
The Reverend Marvin Ingalls is responsible for posting the announcements. He uses a key from his office to open the bulletin board box, pins the notice, and then locks the box again. He also has a duplicate key at home.

Step 3: Investigate the sequence of events
Wallace Anders came to the parish office last night to post the announcement of his engagement to Sheila Ingalls. However, the announcement that was posted was for his engagement to Georgette Pelham. Georgette Pelham also visited the office last night, half an hour after Wallace Anders.

Step 4: Consider the motives of the suspects
- Sheila Ingalls has a motive to frame Georgette Pelham, as she is being replaced by her.
- Georgette Pelham has a motive to frame Sheila Ingalls, as she wants to marry Wallace Anders.
- Reverend Marvin Ingalls has a motive to frame Sheila Ingalls, as he might not want his daughter to marry Wallace Anders.
- Wallace Anders has a motive to frame Sheila Ingalls, as he might not be serious about marrying her.

Step 5: Analyze the alibis of the suspects
- Sheila Ingalls was walking from the parsonage to the church when she discovered the forgery. She didn't mention being in the parsonage during the time Wallace Anders visited the office.
- Georgette Pelham visited the office last night, which could have given her the opportunity to post the forged announcement.
- Reverend Marvin Ingalls was at home with his duplicate key, which could have allowed him to post the forged announcement.
- Wallace Anders was at the parsonage when he proposed to Sheila Ingalls, and later visited the office to post the announcement.

Step 6: Consider the inconsistencies in the story
The Reverend Ingalls mentioned that he glanced at the paper before posting it, but he couldn't see well. This raises the question of whether he actually read the paper or just assumed it was correct. If he didn't read it carefully, it's possible that he posted the wrong announcement.

Step 7: Make a conclusion based on the evidence
Given the inconsistencies in the Reverend Ingalls' story and his potential motive to frame Sheila Ingalls, I believe that the Reverend Marvin Ingalls is the most likely culprit. He had the opportunity to post the forged announcement with his duplicate key and his poor eyesight could be an excuse for not reading the paper carefully.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The men arrive at the abandoned mining shack, and Sam Connors gives Big George the task of covering the back in case Pee Wee decides to break out a window and escape. However, when they enter the shack, Big George's machine gun is found on the floor, and he claims to have dropped it in the excitement. This suggests that Big George might not have been covering the back as instructed.

2.  During the shootout, Big George is the only one who is outside the shack and gets a bullet winged in his ear, but his machine gun is found inside. This implies that Big George was likely shooting from inside the shack and got hit while doing so.

3.  Pee Wee Galento, the target of the raid, is killed but doesn't fire a single shot. This suggests that the other suspects might have been involved in the shootout.

4.  The fact that Pee Wee didn't fire a shot and was killed by multiple bullets implies that the suspects might have been shooting at each other rather than at Pee Wee. This raises questions about their intentions and potential motives.

5.  When questioned about the shootout, Slim Jameson says that ""it don't matter"" that he got a chunk taken out of his thigh, indicating that he's more concerned about the loot than the casualties. This suggests that Slim might have a motive for the shootout.

6.  Joe Franklin, on the other hand, is more concerned about his injuries and the fact that Pee Wee didn't fire a shot. He seems to be more focused on the task at hand, which is to apprehend Pee Wee.

7.  Chester Morris is the last one to enter the shack and claims to have been keeping the front door covered. However, he doesn't seem to have been involved in the shootout, and his shotgun is not mentioned as being used.

Considering the evidence, the most suspicious behavior is exhibited by Big George Ratcliffe. He was tasked with covering the back but had his machine gun inside the shack, and he was the only one who got shot while being outside the shack. This suggests that Big George might have been involved in the shootout and might have been the one who killed Pee Wee Galento.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  Ren predicted the American attack on Japan, which was initially dismissed by Admiral Taro. However, the attack happened, and Ren was arrested for treason.

2.  Ren discovered that a sentinel ship spotted an American Navy carrier 650 miles away, and a second message was sent to confirm the sighting. However, the admiral claimed that the second message never arrived.

3.  Gina, the night messenger, revealed that she delivered the second message to the admiral, but he claimed not to have received it. Gina also mentioned that she dropped the message while trying to clear the table during dinner and spilled tea on it, which the admiral dried with a towel and said was still legible.

4.  Kira, Ren's schoolmate, had the second message in her possession and was questioned by the police.

5.  The admiral himself was present throughout the investigation and was the one who questioned Ren during the court trial.

Now, let's analyze the suspects:

- Admiral Taro: As the person in charge of the military, Admiral Taro had access to the second message and was the one who questioned Ren during the trial. However, the fact that he claimed not to have received the second message and that Gina delivered it to him raises suspicions.

- Gina: Gina delivered the second message to Admiral Taro, but she claimed that she dropped it and spilled tea on it, which the admiral dried and said was still legible. This could be a plausible explanation for why the admiral claimed not to have received the message.

- Kira: Kira had the second message and was questioned by the police. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the crime.

- The Emperor: There is no direct evidence linking the Emperor to the crime, but the fact that the Admiral was questioning Ren during the trial and was in charge of the military investigation raises suspicions about the Emperor's involvement.

Based on the evidence, I believe that Admiral Taro is the most likely suspect. The fact that he claimed not to have received the second message, despite Gina delivering it to him, raises suspicions about his involvement in the crime. Additionally, as the person in charge of the military, he had access to the second message and was the one who questioned Ren during the trial.",Unknown,Admiral Taro,119
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **Location of the glassine ornament**: The glassine ornament was placed near the top of the small Christmas tree, out of reach of the younger children. This indicates that the thief must have been able to climb up to the tree or have been tall enough to reach it.
2. **Timeframe of the ornament's disappearance**: The glassine ornament was still present when Marie took a quick glance at it as she walked out the door to go downtown. It was only after the family returned and began unwrapping gifts that the ornament went missing.
3. **Activities of the family members**: The family members were engaged in various activities during the gift unwrapping process:
	* Mike was on his knees underneath the tree, passing out gifts.
	* Lennie was also on his knees underneath the tree, unwrapping gifts.
	* Sandy and Jackie were sitting nearby, unwrapping gifts together.
	* Tommy was on the floor, opening and studying his gifts.
	* Crosby was sitting in a chair, unwrapping his gifts.
	* Edith and Granddad Hadley were sitting on the sofa or chairs, unwrapping their gifts.
4. **Physical characteristics of the suspects**: The suspects are:
	* Jackie (8 years old, sitting by her mother and infant brother)
	* Lennie (5 years older than Mike, slender and almost 6 feet tall)
	* Mike (9 years old, average height and slightly chubby)
	* Sandy (9 years old, no specific physical description)
	* Tommy (10 years old, no specific physical description)
5. **Behavior of the suspects**: During the gift unwrapping process:
	* Lennie and Mike were both on their knees underneath the tree, which means they had direct access to the glassine ornament.
	* Jackie was sitting by her mother, not near the tree.
	* Sandy was sitting nearby, unwrapping gifts with her sister.
	* Tommy was on the floor, but he was opening and studying his gifts, not near the tree.

Considering these points, the most likely suspect is someone who had direct access to the glassine ornament and was in a position to take it without being noticed. The fact that Marie suspected one of the grandchildren and asked ""Why did you take it?"" suggests that she had a good idea of who took the ornament.

**GUILTY: Mike**",Mike**,Lennie Hadley,120
"To determine who is guilty of spreading misinformation, I will carefully analyze the evidence presented in the pageant.

1. **Analysis of Evidence:**

- **Miles Standish's Statements:**
   - Miles Standish claimed that his wife, Rose, died in January 1621, a few months after the Mayflower landed. However, there is no historical record of Rose Standish dying in January 1621. This could be a fabrication.
   - Miles Standish also said that he was a ""grim old widower"" and that he was ""one of the shortest men in the colony."" While this could be true, there is no historical record to support the first statement.

- **John Alden's Statements:**
   - John Alden claimed that he was a farmer in England and that the Pilgrims were losing their English nature and adopting Dutch ways in the Netherlands. This is consistent with historical accounts, as the Pilgrims did face cultural assimilation in the Netherlands.
   - John Alden also mentioned that a family legend says he was asked by Miles Standish to propose marriage to Priscilla on his own behalf, which is consistent with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem ""The Courtship of Miles Standish.""

- **Priscilla Mullins' Statements:**
   - Priscilla Mullins mentioned that her family died in the first winter, which is consistent with historical records.
   - Priscilla also said that John Alden proposed to her, not Miles Standish, which is consistent with the family legend and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem.

- **William Bradford's Statements:**
   - William Bradford correctly stated that Governor Carver died of a heat stroke in 1621, making him the first Governor of Plimoth Plantation.
   - William Bradford also correctly stated that the Wampanoag Indians provided five deer for the first Thanksgiving feast.

2. **Reasoning:**
   Based on the analysis, it appears that Miles Standish made two statements that were likely fabricated: his wife's death in January 1621 and his being a ""grim old widower."" While these statements may have been intended to add drama to the pageant, they are not supported by historical records.

3. **Conclusion:**
   Given the evidence and analysis, the guilty person is the one who fabricated historical facts to add drama to the pageant.

GUILTY: Miles Standish",Miles Standish,John Alden,121
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **The turkey's disappearance**: The turkey vanished from the oven, and there was a trail of juice leading from the oven to the refrigerator. This suggests that the perpetrator moved the turkey from the oven to the refrigerator.

2. **The trail of juice**: The trail of juice was mopped up halfway across the kitchen. This indicates that the perpetrator was trying to cover their tracks, which implies that they were trying to avoid being caught.

3. **Greg's alibi**: Initially, Greg was in the living room watching the football game. However, when the father went to the store to buy cranberry sauce, Greg decided to go with him. This suggests that Greg was not the one who stole the turkey, as he was with the father at the time of the theft.

4. **Darby's behavior**: Darby was excited about the turkey and tried to jump on the counter to get a closer look. However, Darby was taken out for a walk and put on a chain in the backyard before the turkey disappeared. It's unlikely that Darby would have been able to sneak back into the house and steal the turkey.

5. **Uncle Larry's behavior**: Uncle Larry was overexcited about the turkey and gave advice on how to cook it. However, when the mother corrected him about the need for 12 hours of soaking time, he seemed to accept it. There is no clear motive for Uncle Larry to steal the turkey.

6. **Father's behavior**: The father was in charge of cooking the turkey and was preparing it before it disappeared. He seemed to be in a good mood when he returned with the cranberry sauce, but there is no clear motive for him to steal the turkey.

7. **Tina's clue**: Tina put all the clues together and revealed that she knew where the turkey was and who put it there. This suggests that Tina had a clear understanding of the events and was not just making an accusation.

Given the evidence and the analysis, the most plausible explanation is that Tina was the one who stole the turkey. The clues point to her as the culprit:

* She was the one who put all the clues together and revealed the location of the turkey.
* She was suspicious of Greg and initially thought he might have stolen the turkey.
* She was the one who noticed the trail of juice and suggested that someone had mopped it up to cover their tracks.

The fact that Tina was able to put all the clues together and reveal the truth suggests that she was the one who stole the turkey and was trying to cover her tracks.

GUILTY: Tina",Tina,Father,122
"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence presented in the poem. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

1.  The first clue is that the farmer returns to his yard with a dinner to prepare, but he can't find his axe to slaughter the turkey. This means the axe must have been removed or destroyed.
2.  The poem states that the farmer looks around and finds sawdust in a messy pile near the turkey pen, indicating that the axe was likely broken or destroyed with a beak.
3.  The poem also mentions that it would take at least a week to destroy an axe with a beak, which implies that the turkey must have had enough time to do so before the farmer returned.
4.  Now, let's examine the behavior and characteristics of each suspect:
   - Rusty is described as being worried, sad, and frightened throughout the poem. He's the one who is most concerned about being eaten and is gloomy about his fate. This behavior doesn't suggest that he's the one who destroyed the axe.
   - Tiny is described as laughing and teasing Rusty, but he's not portrayed as being particularly resourceful or clever. His behavior doesn't suggest that he's the one who destroyed the axe.
   - Tom is described as strutting around and trying to impress Libby, but he's not mentioned as being particularly resourceful or clever either. His behavior doesn't suggest that he's the one who destroyed the axe.
   - Libby is described as being shy and not leaving the turkey pen, even when the sun shines. However, she's also described as being cute and liked by the other turkeys. The poem mentions that the turkeys liked Tom's joke, but it doesn't explicitly state that Libby didn't like it. However, the poem does say that Libby ""yawned, and took a nap,"" which could suggest that she was trying to avoid drawing attention to herself. The fact that she's described as being cute and liked by the other turkeys also makes it less likely that she's the one who destroyed the axe, as she might have been more concerned about not wanting to be noticed.
5.  However, the poem does mention that ""any day could be your last,"" which suggests that the turkeys are aware of their mortality and might be more willing to take risks to avoid their fate. This line could suggest that Libby is more cunning and resourceful than initially meets the eye.
6.  Given the evidence, I believe that Libby is the most likely suspect. The fact that she's described as being cute and liked by the other turkeys suggests that she might be more clever and resourceful than initially meets the eye. Her behavior of yawning and taking a nap could be a ruse to avoid drawing attention to herself, and her ability to avoid being noticed might be a sign of her cunning nature.

GUILTY: Libby",Libby,Rusty,123
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **The motive:** The turkeys overheard Farmer MacDougall and the stranger discussing the possibility of one of them being sent to the Mission for Thanksgiving dinner. This creates a motive for the turkeys to want to stop this from happening.

2. **The opportunity:** The turkeys had the chance to set up the accident when Farmer MacDougall walked into the barn to milk Brown Betty the cow. This was a relatively isolated area, and the turkeys could have easily set up the rake to strike Farmer MacDougall.

3. **The means:** The turkeys have powerful legs and long, strong toes, making it possible for them to drag the rake into position.

4. **The evidence:** The rake was found with a tail feather on it, which suggests that one of the turkeys was involved in the setup.

5. **The behavior of the suspects:**
   - Beaker suggested writing to the President for a pardon, which seems like an unlikely plan for someone who might be guilty.
   - Beau suggested that one of the turkeys should cause an accident, which is a more direct approach, but it's not clear if he was serious or just joking.
   - Red didn't seem to have any plan or motivation to stop the accident from happening.
   - Leaf, on the other hand, was the only one who seemed to seriously consider the idea of causing an accident to stop Farmer MacDougall from sending one of them to the Mission.

Considering these points, the most likely suspect is Leaf. He was the only one who seemed to take the idea of causing an accident seriously, and his behavior in the barn on the second Tuesday in October matches the time when the accident occurred. Additionally, Leaf was the newest addition to the flock, which might have made him more desperate to protect himself.

GUILTY: Leaf",Leaf,Beau,124
"To determine the guilty party, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1. **Muddy Dog Prints**: The grandfather noticed a set of muddy dog prints leading from the basement steps to the table where the turkey once sat. This indicates that the perpetrator is likely the dog, as it would have walked on the floor and left behind muddy prints. However, since the dog, Jack, was not present when the grandfather noticed the prints, it suggests that the prints were likely made by the robotic dog, which had been brought by Chris. This could be a red herring, but it's worth noting.

2. **Behavior of the Family Members**: Rachel, Chris, and Diane all have motives for stealing the turkey. Rachel is stressed and reluctant to host the family gathering, Chris doesn't like the get-togethers, and Diane has a history of holding ill feelings towards Rachel. However, their alibis are also suspicious. Rachel is relieved when the turkey is missing, Chris seems uninterested in the situation, and Diane seems guilty when questioned by her father-in-law.

3. **The Robotic Dog's Behavior**: The robotic dog's actions are crucial in understanding the events. When the first dog, Jack, yipped, the robotic dog barked in response. When the robotic dog was startled by Jack, it bit at him. This behavior suggests that the robotic dog is not just a simple toy, but a device that can respond to stimuli. Furthermore, the robotic dog's ability to walk into a wall and leave footprints indicates that it has some level of autonomy.

4. **The Clue of the Footsteps**: When the robotic dog falls down the stairs, it's clear that it has been tampered with or controlled remotely. The fact that it leaves footprints in its wake suggests that it was used as a tool to commit the crime.

5. **Chris's Motive and Alibi**: Chris brought the robotic dog, which was used to steal the turkey. He has a motive to be uninterested in the situation, as he dislikes family gatherings. His comment about the family fighting allowing them to leave earlier also suggests that he's trying to deflect attention from himself.

Considering all the evidence, the most likely culprit is Chris, who brought the robotic dog and used it to steal the turkey. His motive, alibi, and the behavior of the robotic dog all point to his guilt.

GUILTY: Chris",Chris,Chris,125
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. Ed Beatty, a keen observer and private investigator, noticed the following about each porter:
   - Porter 1 was a bit clumsy.
   - Porter 2 was a distinguished-looking man with impeccable manners, but also seemed tired.
   - Porter 3 was slightly standoffish but had a well-fitted and freshly pressed uniform.
   - Porter 4 was young-looking, but had a smooth and efficient manner.

2. Ed also noted the following about the order of the porters' shifts:
   - Porter 1 was on duty when Ed arrived at the train station.
   - Porter 2 took over from Porter 1, but Ed didn't notice anything unusual about Porter 2's behavior.
   - Porter 3 took over from Porter 2, but Ed noted that Porter 3's uniform was well-fitted and freshly pressed, suggesting that Porter 3 might have been the one who had been assigned to Ed's car from the beginning.
   - Porter 4 was the last porter Ed interacted with before going to sleep.

3. The fact that Ed's briefcase was stolen from under his nose suggests that the thief must have been one of the porters who had access to his cabin.
   - Porter 1 and Porter 2 had access to Ed's cabin earlier in the day, but there is no indication that they stole the briefcase.
   - Porter 3 was on duty when Ed went to sleep, but Ed noted that Porter 3's uniform was well-fitted and freshly pressed, suggesting that Porter 3 might have been the one who had been assigned to Ed's car from the beginning.
   - Porter 4 was the last porter Ed interacted with before going to sleep, and Ed noted that Porter 4 had a smooth and efficient manner, which suggests that Porter 4 might have been the one who stole the briefcase.

4. However, the fact that Porter 4 was young-looking and seemed out of place among the other porters suggests that Porter 4 might be an imposter. This, combined with the fact that Ed's briefcase was stolen from under his nose, suggests that Porter 4 was likely the thief.

5. Therefore, based on the evidence, the most likely culprit is Porter 4.

GUILTY: Porter 4",Porter 4,Porter 3,126
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Connor's bike was broken, and Tim's mom gave them a ride to the fair. This suggests that Connor might be in a financial situation, which could be a motive for theft.
   - Emma is portrayed as a goth and appears disinterested, which might suggest she's not motivated by material possessions or money.
   - Bethany is rich and seems confident, but there's no direct indication of her motive for theft.

2. **Events Leading Up to the Theft:**
   - Connor is the first to go to the bathroom, and when he returns, his cashbox is empty. This is a crucial point, as it's the first opportunity for someone to steal the money.
   - Tim is distracted by the spill of his snacks and doesn't notice anyone suspicious.
   - Bethany is playing with her cellphone and doesn't seem to be paying attention.
   - Emma is under the table, retrieving her backpack, and doesn't seem to be involved in the theft.

3. **Key Evidence:**
   - Milton notices that the cashbox is empty, and there are 24 tickets left, which suggests that the thief didn't take the tickets, only the money.
   - Milton's reaction is to search everyone's belongings and persons, but then he changes his mind, suggesting that he has a different plan.

4. **Milton's Epiphany:**
   - Milton's sudden change of heart and his statement that he knows who took the money implies that he has a reason to believe the theft was an inside job.
   - Milton is responsible for the fair's finances, and he's under pressure to ensure that the event raises a significant amount of money for the Children's Hospital.
   - Milton's ""aha"" moment suggests that he's thinking about the situation in a different way, possibly considering the motives and actions of his volunteers.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the evidence, it's clear that Milton has a reason to believe one of his volunteers is responsible for the theft.
   - Milton's change of heart and his decision to forgo searching everyone's belongings suggests that he's trying to protect one of the volunteers.
   - The most likely explanation is that Milton is trying to cover up the theft himself, as he's the one who benefits from the money being stolen.

"To analyze the evidence and determine who is guilty, I will carefully examine the details provided in the story.

1.  The theft occurred when the box was left unlocked. This means that the person who stole the pins had access to the room and the box.

   - Ryan Smith, the delivery boy, brought the box to City Hall, but he did not have access to the room where the pins were kept.
   - Mr. Landry and Colonel Abraham were the ones who opened the box to check the engraving, but they claimed to have locked it up after that.
   - Frank Thompson, the custodian, was the one who had the key to the room, which means he had access to the box at all times.

2.  The police officer noticed a plug of tobacco near the cardboard box. This suggests that someone might have been smoking near the area where the pins were kept.

   - The custodian, Frank Thompson, admitted to spitting chewed tobacco into a cup, which implies that he was the one who was smoking near the box.
   - Colonel Abraham gave the custodian a plug of tobacco earlier, which suggests a possible motive for the theft.

3.  The custodian's behavior and the fact that he was given tobacco by Colonel Abraham create a suspicious link between the two.

   - Colonel Abraham had a motive to steal the pins, as they were worth a significant sum and he was a well-known member of the community.
   - The custodian's involvement in the theft seems unlikely, as he would have been the one to report the missing pins and be concerned about being accused.
   - Mr. Landry's alibi seems to be solid, as he and Ryan Smith both checked the box and then locked it up.

Based on the analysis, the evidence points to Colonel Abraham as the most likely suspect. The motive, the link between him and the custodian, and the suspicious behavior of the custodian all contribute to this conclusion.

GUILTY: Colonel Abraham",Colonel Abraham,Colonel Abraham,128
"To analyze the evidence and determine who is guilty, I will break down the story into key points and examine each suspect's alibi and potential motives.

1. **Key Points:**
   - The Beamer is dropped off at Joe's Garage with a reported problem.
   - The Beamer's owner, Cameron Carlyle, is looking for a special occasion to propose to his girlfriend, Meghan, and mentions that he had a ring in the glove compartment.
   - The ring is an expensive, designer engagement ring.
   - The garage owner, Joe Morgan, claims to have checked the vehicle for valuables but might not have done so due to being busy.
   - A schoolteacher, Mr. Bridges, drops off his car at the garage and is surprised to see the Beamer, which he can't afford.
   - Fingers Ferguson, a skilled mechanic, is skeptical of the garage's business practices and thinks Joe might have taken the ring.
   - Manuel Garcia, a mechanic, is eager to advance in his career and mentions that he didn't work on the Beamer.

2. **Analyzing Suspects:**

   - **Fingers Ferguson:** Fingers is a skilled mechanic with a history of picking pockets. He has a motive to steal the ring, as he's skeptical of the garage's business practices and thinks Joe might be tempted to take valuables. However, he claims to have never seen the ring and didn't work on the Beamer. His alibi seems plausible, but his history and skepticism make him a prime suspect.
   - **Joe Morgan:** Joe is the garage owner, and his business has been struggling. He has a motive to take the ring, especially if he's been tempted by the high-end items customers bring in. He claims to have checked the vehicle but might have been too busy. His alibi is shaky, but he has a plausible explanation.
   - **Manuel Garcia:** Manuel is eager to advance in his career and is interested in the Beamer. However, he claims to have worked on other vehicles and didn't touch the Beamer. His alibi seems solid, and he has a clear motive to be dishonest, but he's also eager to join the police academy and become a law-abiding citizen.
   - **Mr. Bridges:** Mr. Bridges is a schoolteacher who can't afford the Beamer. He has a motive to steal the ring, but he's also surprised to see the Beamer and claims to have dropped off his car earlier. His alibi seems plausible, but he's not a skilled mechanic, and it's unlikely he could have pulled off the theft.

3. **Final Analysis:**
After examining the evidence and analyzing each suspect's alibi and motive, I believe the most likely culprit is **Joe Morgan**. While Fingers Ferguson has a suspicious history and a motive to steal, his alibi seems solid, and he didn't work on the Beamer. Manuel Garcia's alibi is also solid, and he's eager to become a law-abiding citizen. Mr. Bridges' alibi is plausible, but he's not a skilled mechanic, and it's unlikely he could have pulled off the theft. Joe Morgan's shaky alibi, combined with his business struggles and temptation to take valuables, make him the most likely suspect.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  **Initial Observations**: 
    - Steven notices that the keys on the keyboard are not in their normal order. Key number 1 is hung upside down, and key number 3 is hung backwards.
    - The smallest key, key number 1, is associated with the upstairs bedroom, and key number 3 is associated with the same bedroom.
    - There is no indication that anyone has entered the house when Steven is at home, but he suspects that one of his children is sneaking in when he's away.

2.  **First Incident**: 
    - When Steven hides in the upstairs closet, he hears someone enter the house and replace a key on the keyboard, but the visitor doesn't come upstairs. The sound of the visitor opening a door seems to come from the far side of the house, suggesting that the visitor is likely going to the master bedroom or Kirsten's room.

3.  **Second Incident**: 
    - A few days later, when Steven hides in the closet again, the visitor comes upstairs and enters a room, but Steven can't tell which one. The visitor flees when they hear Steven's phone ring.

4.  **Third Incident**: 
    - During the third incident, the visitor leaves the key in daughter Denise's bedroom door.

5.  **Additional Clues**: 
    - Steven notices that key number 4 has dust on it, and key number 6 has been used and put away twice.
    - He also finds a new silk handkerchief on the upstairs hall floor.

6.  **Analyzing the Suspects**:
    - April: Associated with key #4, which has dust on it, suggesting that she may not have been the one using it recently.
    - Denise: Associated with key #6, which has been used and put away twice, indicating that she may be the one using it.
    - Harold: Associated with key #1, which is hung upside down, suggesting that he may be the one tampering with the keys.
    - Kirsten: The visitor's footsteps seem to come from her side of the house during the first incident, but she's not the only one who could have been in the master bedroom.
    - Robert (Buddy): Associated with key #3, which is hung backwards, suggesting that he may be the one tampering with the keys.

7.  **Putting It All Together**:
    - The key that's been used and put away twice is key #6, which is associated with Denise. This suggests that Denise is the one sneaking into the house.
    - The fact that the visitor leaves the key in Denise's bedroom door during the third incident further supports this conclusion.

"To determine who is guilty, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. The game was lost due to a foul ball that Joe missed, but Larry claims that Mrs. Williams was betting against the team, making a fortune from the loss. This suggests that Mrs. Williams had a motive to manipulate the game.

2. Mrs. Williams was caught by the police with a briefcase full of money, but it was later found that the money was not in the crate of baseball mitts she was donating to charity. This implies that Mrs. Williams had hidden the money elsewhere.

3. Mrs. Williams made a phone call to an unknown person saying ""The money's buried at home."" This statement, combined with the fact that the police searched the coach's house and the private cottage by the lake, suggests that Mrs. Williams was not talking about either of those locations.

4. The groundskeeper, Gary, revealed that someone walked through the locker room around midnight, carrying a crate, and dug up the ground near the batting cage. This is a crucial piece of evidence, as it suggests that the person who buried the money was someone who had access to the stadium and was familiar with the layout.

5. The fact that the police searched the coach's house from top to bottom and didn't find the crate suggests that the coach was not involved in hiding the money.

6. The fact that the coach and Mrs. Williams lived together in a big yellow house, and the private cottage by the lake, suggests that when Mrs. Williams said ""home"" in the phone call, she was not referring to either of those locations.

7. The fact that the police searched the stadium and didn't find the crate, but Gary, the groundskeeper, was familiar with the stadium and knew that no one had dug up the field since the incident, suggests that the person who buried the money was someone who worked at the stadium.

Considering all the evidence, it's clear that Mrs. Williams was not the person who buried the money. The coach was cleared of suspicion after the police searched his house. Roderick was a gambler who was involved in other crimes, but there's no evidence that he buried the money.

The only person left who fits the description of someone who worked at the stadium and had access to the locker room is Joe. However, the text states that Joe had never met Mrs. Williams and hadn't heard the legend of the million-dollar mitts. But, this can be explained by the fact that Joe didn't work at the stadium during the time Mrs. Williams was betting on the game. However, it is also stated that Joe is a retired player who met Larry on the anniversary of their last game, which implies that Joe was a player during the time the game was lost.

Considering all the evidence, it is most likely that Joe, as the retired first baseman, was the one who dug up the ground near the batting cage and buried the crate of money.",Unknown,Joe,131
"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the key clues**

1. The two children, Mark and Ann, visited a dark and deserted house on Halloween night. They noticed strange noises and saw a dirty flashlight on the porch.
2. Ann used the flashlight to explore the house, and they discovered a staircase with footprints leading up to the second floor.
3. Mark and Ann heard 14 screams from upstairs, and Mark went to investigate. He found two ghostly heads, one belonging to a man (the Indian Chief) and one belonging to a woman (the Wealthy Woman).
4. The two ghostly heads explained that they had died in the past (the Indian Chief in a fight and the Wealthy Woman from a sickness) and were unable to rest due to some earthly disturbance.
5. Later, two more ghostly heads appeared, belonging to a bride and a groom, who were also unable to rest due to the disturbance.

**Step 2: Analyze the behavior of the suspects**

1. The Indian Chief and the Wealthy Woman were both concerned about being disturbed and wanted to rest in peace.
2. The bride and groom, however, seemed more agitated and concerned about the disturbance.
3. The bride and groom also seemed to be arguing with each other, and the groom was particularly angry and accusatory.

**Step 3: Look for inconsistencies in the alibis**

1. The Indian Chief and the Wealthy Woman both claimed to have died in the past, but the bride and groom seemed to be more recently deceased, as they mentioned wearing high-heeled slippers and ballet shoes, respectively.
2. The bride and groom also seemed to be more concerned about the disturbance, which could imply that they were more recently awakened.

**Step 4: Identify the motive and the means**

1. The motive for the disturbance seems to be a prank or a trick played on the ghostly heads.
2. The means of the disturbance is the ""ghostly goo"" that was used to make the ghostly heads glow, which was likely a prank or a trick.

**Step 5: Combine the evidence and analyze the suspects**

Based on the evidence and analysis, I believe that the GUILTY person is the **GROOM**.

The Groom seemed to be more agitated and accusatory than the other ghostly heads, and his behavior seemed to be more suspicious. Additionally, his concern about the disturbance and his argument with the bride suggest that he may have been involved in the prank or trick that awakened the other ghostly heads.

The Groom's motive for the disturbance could be to draw attention to himself and to cause chaos among the other ghostly heads, which would explain his angry and accusatory behavior. The means of the disturbance, the ""ghostly goo,"" could have been used by the Groom to make the other ghostly heads glow and to create the illusion that they were being disturbed.

Therefore, based on the evidence and analysis, I conclude that the GUILTY person is the **GROOM**.",Unknown,Groom,132

2. The second child was the lion, who came with his father and headed towards the Smith home after receiving the treat. This doesn't give us any information about the lion's direction of travel.

3. The third child was the ghost, who came from the direction of the driveway (which is on the west side of the property) and headed east after receiving the treat. This is crucial information.

4. The fourth child was Superman, who didn't give any information about his direction of travel.

5. The fifth child was Dorothy, who went west after leaving the McAnn's house.

Now, let's combine the information from the third and fifth points: The ghost came from the direction of the driveway (west) and headed east, and Dorothy went west. This means that the ghost and Dorothy cannot be the same child, because the ghost went east and Dorothy went west.

The only child who came from the direction of the driveway (west) is the ghost. The other children came from the east. Therefore, the ghost must be the child who came from the west and was wearing a ghost costume.

Given this information, the only direction that doesn't match the direction of travel for any of the other children is the west. The ghost came from the west and headed east, and the only child who went west is Dorothy.

However, we know that the ghost and Dorothy cannot be the same child. This means that the ghost is actually the child who came from the west and headed east, but we don't know who that child is yet.

The key piece of information is that the lion came with his father and headed towards the Smith home. We know that the Smiths live to the east of the McAnn's house, so the lion and his father must have come from the west and headed east.

This means that the lion's father must be the one who came from the west, which matches the direction of travel for the ghost. This means that the lion is not the ghost, but the lion's father is.

The only person left who could be the ghost is the lion's father, but that's not one of the suspects. The only other person who came from the west is Superman, but we don't have any information about Superman's direction of travel.

However, we do know that Superman was the fourth child to visit and that the lion and his father were the second and third children. This means that the lion's father must have come before Superman, which means that the lion's father cannot be the ghost.

The only person left who could be the ghost is Superman, but we don't have any information about his direction of travel. However, we do know that the ghost came from the west and headed east, and the only child who went west is Dorothy. This means that Superman must be the ghost.

Now, let's look at the other clues. We know that the ghost came from the west and headed east, and Superman is the ghost. We also know that the ghost and Dorothy cannot be the same child, because the ghost went east and Dorothy went west.

This means that the only child who could be the ghost is Superman, and the only child who went west is Dorothy. This means that Dorothy is the one who pulled the prank.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and provide a step-by-step reasoning.

1. The first clue is that the pumpkin was rigged to fly using a fishing line and a pulley system. This suggests that the perpetrator had access to these materials and knew how to use them.

2. The pumpkin was placed in a way that it seemed to be ""grinning"" at the group, and it had huge, grotesque eyes carved into it. This suggests that the perpetrator wanted to create a spooky and intimidating effect.

3. The timing of the incident is also suspicious. The group was visiting the Mitchelson house on Halloween night, and the pumpkin was rigged to fly at the moment they entered the house. This suggests that the perpetrator was waiting for the group to arrive and wanted to scare them.

4. Mary's reaction to being asked to lead the way into the house is suspicious. She initially hesitated and seemed reluctant, which could suggest that she was in on the prank and didn't want to be the one to trigger it.

5. However, Mary's scream when the pumpkin flew up is also a point of interest. Her scream was described as ""high-pitched and girlish,"" which is consistent with a genuine reaction of fear. This could suggest that Mary was not in on the prank and was genuinely scared.

6. The fact that the pumpkin was rigged to fly suggests that the perpetrator was someone who had access to the Mitchelson house and was able to set up the pulley system without being detected.

7. Considering the characters' personalities and motivations, Dabney is the most likely suspect. He was described as someone who enjoys taking dares and goading others into taking them. He also seemed to be the leader of the group, which would give him the opportunity to set up the prank.

8. However, Dabney's sister Mary also seemed to be involved in the prank, at least to some extent. Her initial hesitation and reluctance to lead the way into the house could suggest that she was in on the prank.

9. However, Mary's scream when the pumpkin flew up suggests that she was genuinely scared, which could suggest that she was not in on the prank.

10. Considering the evidence, I think the most likely scenario is that Dabney set up the prank and Mary was in on it, but was also genuinely scared when the pumpkin flew up.

However, since I must choose one person to be guilty, I will choose the person who seems to be the mastermind behind the prank.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Bertram's description of the crime**: The scarecrow's mask was on a pole at the center of the armor exhibit upstairs. Twenty minutes ago, shortly before opening the exhibit, Bertram entered the floor, only to see that pole standing conspicuously bare and empty. This means the theft occurred between 20 minutes ago and the time Bertram entered the floor.

2. **Guests' alibis**: 
   - Charles Kincaid: He was in his room, as evidenced by his comment that he was ""proud of my family tree...And of all the generations that went before, there was only one who achieved infamy in the pages of history."" This suggests that he was researching or writing, as he mentioned a book about the history of famous outlaws.
   - Chester: He was in the cook's quarters, preparing a pecan pie.
   - Mr. and Mrs. Winfrey: They were in their room, as evidenced by their comment that they'd heard the voices of Bertram and the narrator.

3. **The trail of footprints**: Bertram and I discovered a trail of footprints that led to the stairs. This suggests that the thief came from outside the castle, which is unusual given the cold, rainy, and windy night.

4. **The search of rooms**: Bertram and I searched the rooms of the guests, but there was no sign of the scarecrow's mask. This suggests that the thief might have hidden the mask or destroyed it.

5. **The discovery of the potato peel**: On the west staircase, we found a wet and slimy potato peel. This suggests that the thief might have had a snack in the castle.

Now, let's connect the dots:

* If the thief came from outside, as evidenced by the footprints, it's unlikely that the thief was Charles Kincaid, as he was researching in his room.
* Chester was in the cook's quarters, preparing a pecan pie, which is a dessert made from pecans and sugar. It's possible that the pecan pie was a red herring to distract us from the true culprit.
* Mr. and Mrs. Winfrey were in their room, and it's unlikely that they would have gone outside on a cold, rainy, and windy night.
* The discovery of the potato peel on the west staircase suggests that the thief might have had a snack in the castle. Given the pecan pie was a dessert made in the cook's quarters, it's likely that the potato peel was also a snack made in the cook's quarters.

Putting all the pieces together, it's likely that the thief was **Chester**, Bertram's son. He was in the cook's quarters, preparing a pecan pie, and it's possible that he also prepared a snack, a potato peel, in the cook's quarters. This would explain the footprints leading to the stairs, as he might have left the cook's quarters to dispose of the evidence. The pecan pie was a red herring to distract us from the true culprit.

"To analyze the evidence and determine the identity of the scarecrow slasher, let's break down the key points from the story:

1.  The scarecrow is destroyed every night, suggesting that the attacker is targeting it specifically and has a motive for doing so.
2.  The damage to the scarecrow is consistent with a human attacker, as the inspector notes that the tears are not the ragged kind expected if a wild animal had done this.
3.  Mr. Forbes believes that the attacks are sabotage and mentions that he is being targeted, but the inspector is skeptical of his claims.
4.  The butler, Philips, is locked out of the kitchen by Mrs. Avery due to his alleged increased appetite, which suggests that he might have a motive for targeting the scarecrow to gain access to food.
5.  The maid, Annie, sees a single figure cross the field and attacks the scarecrow, but the inspector notes that her description of the figure's agility and movements could be exaggerated or fabricated.
6.  Mrs. Avery mentions that the butler has been locked out of the kitchen for four days, which suggests a motive for Philips to target the scarecrow to gain access to food.
7.  Inspector Gregson finds a glittering necklace among the spare clothes in the attic, which could be a clue to the identity of the scarecrow slasher.

Considering these points, let's analyze the suspects:

- Annie: Annie's description of the figure's agility and movements could be exaggerated or fabricated. While she does see the attack, there is no concrete evidence linking her to the crime.
- Mr. Forbes: Mr. Forbes has a motive for targeting the scarecrow to gain attention and publicity for his business, but the inspector is skeptical of his claims, and there is no concrete evidence linking him to the crime.
- Mrs. Avery: Mrs. Avery has a motive for targeting the scarecrow to distract from the butler's alleged increased appetite and her own locking him out of the kitchen. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the crime.
- Philips: Philips has a clear motive for targeting the scarecrow to gain access to food, as he is locked out of the kitchen by Mrs. Avery. The discovery of the glittering necklace among the spare clothes in the attic suggests that Philips might have been stealing food from the kitchen and using the scarecrow attacks as a diversion.

Considering the motives, evidence, and alibis, the most likely suspect is:

"Analysis of the evidence:

1. **Initial Observations**: The competition is being held at the Yoxley estate, and there is a history of dishonesty and misadventure surrounding the event. The current Lord of Yoxley, Robert, seems to be trying to create a pleasant atmosphere but is met with gruff responses from the judges, particularly Mr. Reese.

2. **Characterization of the Suspects**:
   - **Miss. Jones**: She is described as wearing a tight-fitting dress and no jacket, which Miss. Pendlebury finds unprofessional. Miss. Jones seems defensive about her attire, indicating she might be trying to stand out or make a statement.
   - **Miss. Pendlebury**: She is sharp-tongued and critical, particularly towards Mr. Horgan. She seems to be a perfectionist and might be competitive.
   - **Mr. Horgan**: He is described as being engrossed in the buffet and making a mess with the cream tarts. He is also described as having marks on his jacket, which Miss. Pendlebury criticizes.
   - **Mr. Reese**: He is gruff and seems to be in a hurry to finish the judging process.

3. **Incident Analysis**:
   - The floorboard in the viewing room creaks twice, and each time a judge is ushered into the room. The second creak is unexpected, as Mr. Horgan had already been in the room.
   - Mr. Horgan had been in the viewing room before the second creak, but Miss. Pendlebury appears behind the group and ushers Mr. Horgan into the room, despite the floorboard not creaking when she entered.
   - This implies that Miss. Pendlebury was already in the viewing room when Mr. Horgan was supposed to be in it, indicating she might have switched the artwork.

4. **Motivation Analysis**:
   - Miss. Pendlebury seems to have a competitive nature and a high standard for herself and others.
   - Mr. Horgan is more focused on the buffet than the judging process.
   - Miss. Jones and Mr. Reese seem less invested in the competition, but Miss. Jones is defensive about her attire, which might indicate she is trying to stand out.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the evidence, the most likely culprit is **Miss. Pendlebury**. She was in the viewing room when she was supposed to be elsewhere, and her behavior suggests a competitive and perfectionistic nature. Her criticism of Mr. Horgan and Miss. Jones' attire also implies she might be trying to create a sense of order and control. The fact that she was ushered into the viewing room without the floorboard creaking suggests she might have switched the artwork, making her the most likely suspect.

"Let's analyze the evidence carefully.

1.  The suspects are the Balloon Twister, the Living Statue, and the Mime.
2.  The dog, Rover, was taken from Kinnair McMurray's farm, where a troupe of buskers had camped for the night. The troupe consisted of a mime, a stilt-walker, a living statue, and a balloon twister.
3.  Sir Loch determined that the Edinburgh Festival Fringe was the most likely location of the dognapping, as the troupe had likely traveled to the festival after leaving the farm.
4.  Upon arriving at the festival, Sir Loch and Dr. Watt-Sun found Rover with the troupe and were able to identify the dog.
5.  The stilt-walker had a broken leg, which he claimed was due to a child stumbling into his feet a couple of weeks ago. However, this explanation seems suspicious, as it is unlikely that the child would have stumbled into his feet exactly two weeks ago, and the stilt-walker's claim seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion.
6.  The living statue was initially unresponsive, but when Rover tried to urinate on him, he jumped back, indicating that he was not as inanimate as he seemed.
7.  The balloon twister was seen inflating a balloon, and when she twisted it into a Dalmatian shape, Rover yelped and tried to run away, indicating that he had seen the balloon twister before and was reacting to her presence.
8.  The mime was unable to speak and seemed to be hiding something, but there was no direct evidence linking him to the dognapping.
9.  The balloon twister's reaction to Rover's presence and the fact that she was able to twist a balloon into a Dalmatian shape suggests that she may have had a connection to the dog.
10. The stilt-walker's broken leg and suspicious alibi, combined with the balloon twister's reaction to Rover, make it seem likely that the balloon twister and the stilt-walker are involved in the dognapping.

However, upon closer inspection, it seems that the stilt-walker's broken leg is actually a clue to the identity of the dognapper. The fact that the stilt-walker had duct tape wrapped around his leg suggests that he had recently injured it, but the fact that he claimed it was two weeks ago and that a child had stumbled into his feet is suspicious. However, the broken leg itself is actually a clue to the dognapping.

The balloon twister's reaction to Rover and the fact that she was able to twist a balloon into a Dalmatian shape suggests that she may have had a connection to the dog. However, it is also possible that she was simply reacting to the dog's presence and did not actually take it.

The living statue's initial unresponsiveness and reaction to Rover's urination suggest that he may have been hiding something, but there is no direct evidence linking him to the dognapping.

The mime's inability to speak and suspicious behavior suggest that he may be hiding something, but there is no direct evidence linking him to the dognapping.

Considering all the evidence, it seems that the stilt-walker is the most likely culprit. The fact that he had duct tape on his leg, which he claimed was due to an accident two weeks ago, is suspicious, and the fact that he was able to walk without a limp and even strided away from the scene suggests that he was not actually injured. This, combined with the balloon twister's reaction to Rover and the stilt-walker's own suspicious behavior, makes it seem likely that the stilt-walker was involved in the dognapping.

"To analyze the evidence and determine who is guilty, let's break down the events and clues provided in the mystery story:

1.  The tickets for the violin concert were sent to Sherlock Holmes by an anonymous admirer. This suggests that the person who sent the tickets wanted to lure Holmes to the concert for a specific purpose.

2.  The tickets were for a sold-out concert, and the anonymous admirer had access to the special box seats next to the Royal Box, which was specifically requested. This indicates that the person who sent the tickets had inside information or influence.

3.  The ticket seller remembers the sale perfectly well, even though it was five days ago, and noticed details such as the purchaser being a man in his mid-forties, tall and well dressed. This suggests that the person who sent the tickets was likely someone who had the means and opportunity to buy the tickets in person.

4.  The plainclothes policeman standing outside the Royal Box was informed about the Queen's expected arrival, which was not announced to the public. This implies that the person who sent the tickets had access to confidential information.

5.  Holmes sent a note to Inspector Lestrade, who arrived with his men during the intermission. This suggests that Holmes had reason to believe that a trap was set and that he needed the police to be present.

6.  Holmes whispered something to Lestrade before the arrest was made, which implies that he had identified the person responsible for the plot.

7.  As Holmes looked into the audience below, he saw Professor Moriarty, who was clearly involved in the plot. However, Moriarty was not one of the suspects listed.

Considering the evidence and the process of elimination, let's analyze the suspects:

- Hansom Cab Driver: The cab driver was merely a coincidence and did not have any direct involvement in the plot.

- Policeman: The policeman was informed about the Queen's arrival, which was not publicly announced, suggesting that he might have been involved in the plot. However, he was also working with Inspector Lestrade, and Holmes did not seem to suspect him.

- Theater Usher: The usher brought the drinks to the box and seemed to be following the instructions of the person who sent the tickets. However, there is no direct evidence linking him to the plot.

- Ticket Seller: The ticket seller remembered the sale and noticed details about the purchaser. This suggests that she might have been more than just a ticket seller and had some involvement in the plot.

Based on the evidence, the ticket seller seems to be the most likely suspect. She had access to the special box seats, noticed details about the purchaser, and seemed to be following instructions. This implies that she was involved in the plot to lure Holmes to the concert.

GUILTY: Ticket Seller",Ticket Seller,Theater Usher,139
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. The stolen item is a vial of perfume, specifically the new scent ""Intrigue"" which contains pheromones. This suggests that the thief might be motivated by a desire to gain an advantage or profit from this valuable product.

2. Mr. Walters is the owner of the perfume company and is very superstitious, often carrying a rabbit's foot and wearing a tie with a four-leaf clover. He also has two horseshoes on his wall, which he rubs before starting his day. This behavior suggests that he is trying to ward off bad luck or attract good fortune. However, it's unlikely that he would steal from his own company, especially since he was upset and called the police.

3. Betty, the secretary, is a loyal employee who has been working for Mr. Walters for a while. She seems to genuinely care for him and is willing to defend him. However, she does mention that she had trouble finding a job a few years back and that Mr. Walters gave her a chance despite her lack of experience. This could suggest that she might be motivated to protect him or gain favor with him.

4. Darlene, the assistant, is very excited about the new perfume and seems to be a key player in its development. She also mentions that she doesn't get a percentage of the profits but will get a promotion if the perfume is successful. This could suggest that she is motivated by career advancement and a desire to profit from the perfume's success.

5. Mr. Danby is a competitor in the perfume industry and had a meeting with Mr. Walters the night before the theft. This could suggest that he might be involved in the theft, either directly or indirectly.

6. Mr. Harrison, the janitor, is a new employee who has already given his notice. He mentions that the company has had several janitors leave and that the work environment is not friendly. This could suggest that he might be motivated by a desire to leave the company or seek revenge.

Now, let's analyze the timeline of events:

- Around 7:30 p.m., Mr. Harrison starts cleaning the lab floor.
- Mr. Walters leaves the lab around the same time.
- Darlene notices the missing vial around 8 a.m.
- Betty arrives at the office around 8 a.m.

Considering the timeline, it's likely that the thief would have had to access the lab around 7:30 p.m. to switch the vials. Mr. Harrison was in the lab around that time, but he didn't say anything to Mr. Walters and didn't seem suspicious. However, he did mention that he's a professional and doesn't need to be told what to do, which could suggest that he might be more capable of taking initiative.

However, the key piece of evidence is that Darlene noticed the missing vial around 8 a.m. and that she was the one who pointed out the discrepancy with the vials. This suggests that she might have been trying to cover her tracks or make it seem like someone else was responsible for the theft.

Considering all the evidence, I believe that Darlene is the most likely culprit. She had a clear motive (career advancement and a desire to profit from the perfume's success), she was in a position to access the lab and switch the vials, and she seemed to be trying to deflect suspicion by pointing out the discrepancy with the vials.

GUILTY: Darlene",Darlene,Mr. Harrison,140
"To determine the guilty person, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The first step is to look for any inconsistencies or red flags in each of the plans proposed by the suspects. 

    - Ed the Bludgeoner's plan relies on the element of surprise and the dense fog. However, this plan is not foolproof as it's dependent on the weather, which can change at any moment. Moreover, the plan involves a straightforward attack, which might not be the most sophisticated plan that Professor Moriarty would expect from a seasoned murderer.
    - Herman Houlihan's plan relies on his ability to find an attractive woman to lure Holmes. While this plan might be effective, it's more dependent on chance and the availability of the right woman, which could be unpredictable.
    - Fastidious Fred Fielder's plan is based on his knowledge of Holmes' love for music. He plans to send Holmes tickets to a concert and then have an usher summon him to a fake case. This plan shows a level of sophistication and attention to detail that might be more appealing to Professor Moriarty.
    - Morris the Ascot Dandy's plan relies on Holmes' sense of vanity and the idea that he can be swayed by a new hat. While this plan might be effective, it seems somewhat superficial and less sophisticated compared to the other plans.

2.  The second step is to look for any potential flaws in the plans that could be discovered by Professor Moriarty or the police.

    - Ed the Bludgeoner's plan relies on the element of surprise, which can be disrupted by unexpected events, such as the police presence in the area or unexpected witnesses.
    - Herman Houlihan's plan relies on his ability to find an attractive woman, which can be unpredictable and might not work as expected.
    - Fastidious Fred Fielder's plan is more sophisticated and less dependent on chance. However, it relies on Holmes' attendance at the concert, which might be cancelled or postponed.
    - Morris the Ascot Dandy's plan is less sophisticated and more dependent on Holmes' vanity, which might not be a reliable trait.

3.  The third step is to look for any evidence that suggests a motive or a potential conflict of interest.

    - Ed the Bludgeoner, Herman Houlihan, and Morris the Ascot Dandy all seem to be motivated by a desire to kill Holmes, but there is no clear motive for Fastidious Fred Fielder. However, he does have a personal connection to Holmes, having seen him at concerts and sharing a similar interest in music.

4.  Based on the analysis, Fastidious Fred Fielder's plan is the most sophisticated and less dependent on chance. However, the fact that he has a personal connection to Holmes and has seen him at concerts might suggest that he has a motive to kill Holmes. Furthermore, his plan is more likely to be successful and less likely to be discovered by the police.

1. The goldfish tank in Hussein's bedroom had six goldfish when the American guests left. However, when Princess Salima and her family returned, there were seven goldfish and two of them didn't look like the other five. This suggests that someone added one new goldfish to the tank.

2. The fact that two goldfish didn't look like the other five implies that they were not part of the original six. This means that someone replaced two of the original goldfish with two new ones.

3. Matthew O'Leary mentions that his job was to ensure the President's safety, and he was busy with his work. He doesn't seem to have any motive or opportunity to be involved in the goldfish incident.

4. George Adams was assigned to the delegation to ensure a successful summit and was preoccupied with paperwork. He doesn't seem to have any motive or opportunity to be involved in the goldfish incident.

5. Ermina Glandon, the housekeeper, was the one who discovered the problem with the goldfish tank. She was tasked with cleaning the rooms, but she didn't seem to be involved in adding the new goldfish.

6. Prince Rahim is mentioned as someone who likes to play tricks on his younger brother, Hussein. The fact that two of the goldfish didn't look like the other five suggests that someone might have been trying to play a trick on Hussein. Additionally, Rahim is the one who wrote the note to President Reagan about feeding the goldfish, which suggests that he was interested in the goldfish.

7. Ronald Reagan, the President, is not mentioned as being involved in the goldfish incident at all.

Considering the evidence, the most likely suspect is Prince Rahim. He has a motive (to play a trick on his younger brother) and an opportunity (he was a member of the family who lived in the house). The fact that he likes to play tricks on his brother and wrote a note about the goldfish suggests that he might have been involved in the goldfish incident.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The detective found a footprint at the crime scene, which he took a picture of and then took another picture with his own boot, showing that his boot is size 11. This implies that the footprint is likely from someone with a size 11 boot.
2.  Bill Albertson said he went to the grocery store after purchasing a new hunting knife. This is an interesting piece of information, as Mr. Fletcher is the owner of the grocery store.
3.  The detective found a sunflower seed in the scarecrow's body, which suggests that the perpetrator may have grown sunflowers. Frank Albertson mentioned that he doesn't grow sunflowers on his farm, but Professor Surenie could have grown them. However, this is not a strong enough reason to suspect him yet.
4.  Bill Albertson claimed to have lost his new hunting knife, which is suspicious. If he lost it, he should be able to describe it or remember where he lost it. However, he couldn't remember.
5.  The detective found the scarecrow's head and straw scattered 20 yards away from the body, which suggests that the perpetrator was strong and had a wide-bladed knife.
6.  Frank Albertson mentioned that he had a fight with his son Bill the previous night, and Bill had been upset about losing something he bought.

Now, let's connect the dots:

*   Bill Albertson went to the grocery store after purchasing a new hunting knife, which is the same store owned by Mr. Fletcher. This means that Bill had a motive to lie about losing the knife.
*   Bill Albertson's story about losing the knife is suspicious, and he couldn't remember where he lost it.
*   The detective found a footprint that matches his own boot size 11, but we don't know whose foot it belongs to yet.
*   Frank Albertson's fight with his son Bill the previous night could have motivated Bill to take revenge on his father's scarecrow.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence provided in the story.

1. The first email from Jimmy Bean reveals that his girlfriend, Jane Croydon, returned a broach he bought for her birthday from Craft's Jewelry Store. The broach was on sale, and Jimmy was suspicious that she might have returned the original broach she liked and gotten a credit for it, which would be almost as good as buying the new one. This implies that Jane Croydon might be involved in shoplifting.

2. The second email from Linda reveals that her boyfriend, Steve Kravitz, forgot her birthday and bought her a wrong-sized bathing suit from Mason's Department Store. Although Steve tried to make it right by buying a present and telling a white lie, this incident suggests that Steve might be dishonest and prone to mistakes.

3. The third email from Walt reveals that a girl left a bag with eight unmarked DVDs in the ticket seller's booth at the Acme Movie Complex. The girl was identified as someone Johnny Martin knew from high school, but the email does not provide a clear connection to the suspects.

4. The fourth email from Lester reveals that his girlfriend is color-blind and got him a sweater that is an awful shade of deep orange. Although this incident is not directly related to shoplifting, it implies that the girlfriend might be dishonest and unaware of the consequences of her actions.

5. The inspector's visit reveals that there have been shoplifting incidents at Craft's Jewelry Store, Mason's Department Store, and the Jones Movie Rental Shop. The missing items include a broach, a bathing suit, and DVDs.

Now, let's connect the dots:

* Jane Croydon is the only person who has been directly implicated in shoplifting (returning a broach and possibly exchanging it for a new one). This is consistent with the shoplifting incident at Craft's Jewelry Store.
* Steve Kravitz's behavior in the second email suggests that he might be dishonest, but there is no direct evidence linking him to the shoplifting incidents.
* Johnny Martin is the ticket seller at the Acme Movie Complex, where the girl left a bag with DVDs. However, there is no direct evidence linking him to the shoplifting incidents.
* Martha Hampden is mentioned as a color-blind girl at Centerville High, but there is no direct evidence linking her to the shoplifting incidents.

Based on the analysis, the most likely culprit is Jane Croydon, who has been directly implicated in shoplifting and has a history of dishonest behavior.

"To analyze this mystery, I will break down the key points of evidence and reasoning step by step.

1.  The first clue is that the painting was stolen while everyone was outside, but the dummy and its clothing were also taken from the house. This suggests that the thief must have had access to the house while the others were outside. However, it is also possible that the thief took the dummy and its clothing as a red herring to mislead the investigation.

2.  Inspector Jefferies notes that the guests were all beneficiaries in Mr. Peters' will, and the will had recently been changed due to Mr. Peters' bad investments. This creates a motive for each of the guests to steal the painting, as they would all benefit from its sale.

3.  Lucy claims to have seen what she thought was Mr. Peters' body hanging from the tree and screams for help. However, she had been taking tablets at 2 am and had only been staring at the dummy for a couple of minutes before the others arrived. This suggests that she might have been more disoriented than she lets on.

4.  Iain tripped over a rope while running to see what the commotion was about, which could have been a convenient excuse to create a diversion while the thief escaped.

5.  Daisy was the one who discovered that it was a dummy, not a real body, and she was also the owner of the spaniel that yapped frantically when Inspector Jefferies entered the room. The spaniel's behavior suggests that Daisy might have been trying to distract the inspector from something.

6.  Mr. Peters, the host, seemed to be trying to deflect attention from his own domestic troubles with the spaniel, but this could be a red herring.

7.  Inspector Jefferies seemed to be aware of something and was trying to keep a close eye on the guests, particularly Dale, who was the first to make the group aware that it was a dummy.

Considering these points, I will now analyze each suspect:

- Daisy Morris: She was the first to discover that it was a dummy, not a real body, and her spaniel's behavior suggests that she might have been trying to distract the inspector from something. However, she also seemed to be genuinely concerned about her uncle's domestic troubles.

- Dale Clark: He was the first to make the group aware that it was a dummy, which could be a sign of guilt. However, he also seemed to be genuinely shaken by the events of the morning.

- Iain Potts: He tripped over a rope while running to see what the commotion was about, which could have been a convenient excuse to create a diversion while the thief escaped. However, he also seemed to be genuinely hurt.

- Lucy Smith: She was the one who initially saw what she thought was Mr. Peters' body hanging from the tree and screamed for help. However, she had been taking tablets at 2 am and had only been staring at the dummy for a couple of minutes before the others arrived. This suggests that she might have been more disoriented than she lets on.

Based on the evidence and my analysis, I believe that Lucy Smith is the most likely culprit. She was the first to see what she thought was the body, and her disorientation and confusion could have been a ruse to create an alibi for the theft. Her behavior seemed to be a bit too hasty and emotional, and she seemed to be more concerned with her own situation than with the theft.",Unknown,Dale Clark,145
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Eddie's locker**: The locker room search reveals that Eddie's locker is in order, with no signs of a struggle or any indication that he was taken against his will. This suggests that Eddie might have left voluntarily.

2. **The graph**: Eddie's secret motivational tool, a graph showing various records for high school football, implies that he was driven to succeed. This could be a motivation for him to fake his own disappearance to gain sympathy and attention.

3. **The note**: The note ""Eddie, stop playing, or you'll get hurt, Mae"" suggests that someone was trying to warn Eddie to stop playing football. However, Reggie's suggestion that ""Mae"" is Marissa's nickname for herself raises questions about the note's authenticity. If Marissa was trying to warn Eddie, why would she not have a more direct way of communicating with him?

4. **Marissa's reaction**: Marissa's emotional response to Eddie's disappearance and her apparent lack of concern for his well-being suggest that she might not be as invested in his safety as she claims. Her argument with her father also implies that she might be hiding something.

5. **Mrs. Cavanaugh's sack lunch**: The fact that Eddie's sack lunch was still on the kitchen counter when Mrs. Cavanaugh returned from work implies that Eddie might have left his lunch and then returned to the house, perhaps to stage his disappearance.

6. **Reggie's theory**: Reggie's suggestion that Eddie might have faked his own disappearance to gain sympathy and attention seems plausible, given the evidence.

Considering these points, the most logical conclusion is that Eddie himself is behind his own disappearance. He wanted to create a dramatic situation to gain sympathy and attention, and to make everyone worry about him. This would allow him to maintain his star status and continue to be the center of attention in the town.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence carefully and follow the events step by step.

1. The canary cage was knocked off its table and fell to the floor, breaking the latch and opening the cage door. This suggests that someone or something caused the cage to fall.

2. The open window provides an obvious explanation for the canary's disappearance, but it doesn't explain how the cage fell.

3. Mr. Carstairs stated that his wife had gone upstairs to arrange flowers 20 minutes earlier, but we don't know if she was in the music room at the time of the incident.

4. The maid, Marjorie, reported that everything was normal an hour ago, but she wasn't in the music room at the time of the incident.

5. The children were playing outside with the neighbor's boy, Alex Johnston, and were not in the music room at the time of the incident.

6. The presence of mud stains by the French doors and strands of grass suggests that someone with muddy shoes entered the room through the French doors.

7. The large orange cat, Sarabelle, was found sleeping in the room, but there's no indication that she was involved in the incident.

8. Alex Johnston reported that he was running to catch a frisbee toss and fell, causing the frisbee to go through the window. He then entered the house to retrieve the frisbee and claimed that the noise startled the cat, which might have caused the cage to fall.

9. Jimmy Carstairs corroborated Alex's story, saying that he went into the house to look for the frisbee and didn't notice anything about the birdcage.

10. Lydia Carstairs was drinking from her cup near the house and had a clear view of the house, but she didn't see the canary fly out the window.

11. Given the muddy shoes and grass strands near the French doors, it's likely that Alex or Jimmy entered the room through the French doors, as they were playing outside.

12. However, Lydia's story seems suspicious because she claims to have had a clear view of the house and didn't see the canary fly out the window. If she was near the house, she should have seen the canary fly out the window.

13. Moreover, Lydia's statement that she was ""thirsty"" and took a drink from her cup near the house seems like an alibi, but it's not a very convincing one. She could have easily gone inside the house to drink from her cup without anyone noticing.

14. Considering the evidence, Lydia's alibi is the most suspicious. Her story about having a clear view of the house and not seeing the canary fly out the window is inconsistent with her claim that she was thirsty and took a drink from her cup near the house.

Therefore, based on the analysis of the evidence, I conclude that Lydia Carstairs is the most likely culprit.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence and follow the events step by step.

1.  The first piece of evidence is that the theft occurred when the dairy delivery arrived, and the delivery came to the back of the restaurant. This means that the thief must have been in the kitchen, as they would have had to leave the kitchen to take the money from the cash register in the dining room.
2.  Robert said he left the kitchen only once to greet the dairy deliveryman, and he didn't hear the front door ring, which implies that the thief must have entered or left through the back door, not the front door. This eliminates Dan as a suspect, as he was in charge of keeping the front of the restaurant clean and would have noticed if someone had entered or left through the front door.
3.  David had an alibi for the time of the theft. He was in the kitchen with Teresa, and he had a legitimate reason for being there (he was doing the dishes and accidentally put on rubber gloves, which caused his hands to swell up). This eliminates David as a suspect.
4.  Teresa was also in the kitchen with David and Robert, and she had a clear motive to be in the kitchen (she was baking a cake). However, she was covered in flour, and when she gestured with her hands, flour puffed off her clothes. This suggests that she was likely the one who was in the kitchen the entire time and didn't leave to steal the money.
5.  The final piece of evidence is that Robert said he stayed in the kitchen all morning, watching Teresa make the cake, and he only left to greet the dairy deliveryman. This means that Robert was not in the kitchen the entire time, which creates a window of opportunity for the theft to occur. However, Robert's alibi for the time of the theft is not as strong as Teresa's, as he left the kitchen to greet the deliveryman, and he didn't hear the front door ring, which implies that the thief must have entered or left through the back door, not the front door. But Robert had an opportunity to take the money when he left the kitchen to get the money for the dairy delivery.
6.  However, there is a crucial detail that we can't overlook: when Carol entered the kitchen after returning from her errands, she placed the bag of supplies she bought onto the kitchen counter. She removed the rubber gloves from the bag and placed them into the empty glove holder. David had said that he accidentally put on rubber gloves while doing the dishes and that it made his hands swell up. The fact that the rubber gloves were in the glove holder, but there was no sign of David's swollen hands, suggests that David was not the one who put the gloves on.
7.  Therefore, the only person who had the opportunity to take the money and also had a reason to be in the kitchen the entire time is Teresa. However, the evidence also points to Robert as the thief. He had the opportunity to take the money when he left the kitchen to get the money for the dairy delivery.

Given the evidence, I conclude that the thief is the person who had an opportunity to take the money and also had a reason to be in the kitchen the entire time. The person who had an opportunity to take the money is Robert, and the person who had a reason to be in the kitchen the entire time is Teresa. However, the evidence suggests that Robert is the thief.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. The strongbox was buried under the floorboard of the old barn, and the list of items to be placed in the box was found in a recipe book dated April 27, 1932. This means that the items were likely hidden before May 4, 1932, as indicated by the date on the inside of the box lid.
2. The list included five items: a diamond necklace, CSA currency, a rare lithograph photo of Tom and Marie Patrick, a gold money clip, and a pistol encrusted with rubies and emeralds.
3. Only one of the items was found in the strongbox, which was a mystery to Mr. Patrick and Johnny.
4. The remaining four items were found in different locations: 
    - One item was found in an old ice box in the main house basement.
    - Another item was found in a hollowed-out book in the library.
    - The third item was found in a storage box in the basement storage closet, along with a lock of hair, a brooch, and a hairbrush with a silver backing.
    - The last item was found in an inlaid box full of masculine accoutrements in an abandoned walk-in closet.
5. The fact that the items were hidden in different locations and in various objects suggests that the items were not simply placed in the strongbox because they were valuable, but also because they were significant or sentimental to the family members who hid them.
6. The fact that a lock of hair, a brooch, and a hairbrush with a silver backing were found with one of the items in the storage box suggests that the item found in this location was a personal item, likely something that held sentimental value to Aunt Jean.
7. The fact that the item found in the inlaid box in the abandoned walk-in closet was surrounded by masculine accoutrements suggests that the item was something typically associated with a man.
8. Considering the locations and the items found with each of the remaining four items, we can start to eliminate suspects:
    - The diamond necklace was found in a storage box with a lock of hair, a brooch, and a hairbrush, suggesting that it was a personal item belonging to Aunt Jean.
    - The CSA currency was found in the ice box, which is a common place to store paper documents, but it's unlikely that the family would hide valuable currency in a public place like an ice box.
    - The gold money clip was found in the inlaid box in the abandoned walk-in closet, which suggests that it was a personal item belonging to Uncle John.
    - The lithograph photo was not found in any of the locations, which suggests that it might be the item that was hidden in the strongbox.
9. Considering the locations and the items found with each of the remaining four items, we can conclude that the lithograph photo of Tom and Marie Patrick was the most likely item to be hidden in the strongbox. This is because it was a rare and valuable item that would have been significant to the family, and it was not found in any of the other locations.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The blackmailer is targeting Linda Amberton, demanding a large sum of money to keep her past secret.
2.  The blackmailer knows about Linda's past, specifically that she was caught shoplifting 20 years ago in her hometown of Riverton.
3.  The blackmailer claims that they have proof of this past, but the files are sealed, and the original seal from 20 years ago has been destroyed, making it impossible to obtain the original records.
4.  Inspector Samuels and the detective are staking out the Amberton house, waiting for new communications from the blackmailer.
5.  The first blackmail letter does not specify how the ransom money should be delivered, but the second letter demands that Linda Amberton deliver the money in a flour sack at a secluded location.
6.  Dr. Horace Sage, one of the suspects, had a call from his old friend and fraternity brother, Judge Thornton, before interviewing Linda for a job. This suggests that Judge Thornton may have been involved in covering up Linda's past, but there is no evidence that Dr. Sage is the blackmailer.
7.  Mary Devers, the current courthouse file clerk, had a gossipy predecessor who may have known about Linda's past, but there is no direct evidence linking her to the blackmail.
8.  Susan Royster, an old college friend of Linda's, helped her settle in Centerville and get a fresh start. Susan's response to the question of Linda's shoplifting was that ""she shoplifted in a terrible time. So what!"" which suggests that she may not be the type to harbor resentment or use this information for blackmail.
9.  Martin Amberton, Linda's husband, is not a suspect, as he is unaware of the blackmail attempt and has no motive to blackmail his wife.
10.  Considering the evidence, the most likely suspect is someone who has a personal connection to Linda and has the means to obtain information about her past. Susan Royster is the only one who has a close personal connection to Linda and has the opportunity to obtain information about her past. Her response to the question about Linda's shoplifting suggests that she may not be the type to use this information for blackmail, but her actions may be more calculating than her words.

"To solve this mystery, let's break down the evidence and analyze it step by step.

1. **The Dream**: Sarah had a vivid dream about being accused of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials. She was in Judge Corwin's house, which is a real-life location from the Salem witch trials.

2. **The Trial**: Sarah described the trial, including the testimonies of Adam Browne and his wife, Goodwife Browne. They claimed to have been victims of witchcraft by Sarah. However, their testimony seemed suspicious, as they had a personal stake in the outcome (Adam Browne had once tried to buy the Goodwin farmstead but was denied due to Goodwin's priority in the Colony's militia).

3. **Sarah's Testimony**: Sarah took the stand and denied any involvement in witchcraft. She even recited the Lord's Prayer perfectly, which was seen as proof that she wasn't a witch. However, this may have been a calculated move to gain sympathy from the court.

4. **Abigail's Testimony**: Abigail, a 13-year-old girl, testified against Sarah. However, her testimony was marked by a ""foaming fit,"" and her story seemed unbelievable, as she had never met the Goodwins or the Browns. This behavior could suggest that Abigail was not a reliable witness.

5. **The Judge's Reaction**: Judge Hathorne's reaction to Abigail's testimony was significant. He put on a black cap, which was a symbol of his role as a judge in a witch trial. He then asked Sarah if she had anything to say before reaching a judgment. This suggests that Judge Hathorne was already inclined to find Sarah guilty, which may have been influenced by Abigail's testimony.

6. **The Suspicious Behavior of Adam Browne and Goodwife Browne**: Their testimonies seemed motivated by a personal stake in the outcome. They had a history with the Goodwins, and their accusations may have been a way to settle a score.

Considering these points, let's analyze the suspects:

- **Abigail Thorpe**: Her testimony was marked by a ""foaming fit,"" and her story seemed unbelievable. However, she was only 13 years old and may have been manipulated by the adults in the court.
- **Adam Browne**: He had a personal stake in the outcome and stood to gain from accusing the Goodwins of witchcraft. His testimony seemed suspicious, and he was motivated by a desire to acquire the Goodwin farmstead.
- **Goodwife Browne**: She was equally motivated by a desire to harm the Goodwins and gain from their downfall. Her testimony was also marked by outbursts, which may have been a sign of her guilt.
- **Sarah Goodwin**: While Sarah's testimony seemed genuine, her recitation of the Lord's Prayer may have been a calculated move to gain sympathy from the court.

Based on the analysis, I believe that **Adam Browne** is the most likely suspect. His testimony seemed motivated by a personal stake in the outcome, and his behavior was suspicious. His wife, Goodwife Browne, was also a suspect, but Adam's actions seemed more deliberate and manipulative.

"To determine the guilty person, let's analyze the evidence carefully:

1.  Ed noticed that three clocks and two watches were not running this morning. They were all stopped at different times: 
    a. The grandfather clock (1929) stopped at 10:10 p.m.
    b. The early 20th-century mantle clock stopped at 10:59 p.m.
    c. The 1955 wall clock stopped at 2:01 a.m.
    d. The 1970s wristwatch stopped at 3:18 a.m.
    e. The 1880s silver pocket watch stopped at 5:22 a.m.

2. Ed suspects that one of the timepieces stopped working when the thief broke down the door or broke the display case. However, he also mentions that it would take a lot of shaking to stop the grandfather clock, which had no signs of visible damage. 

3. The mantle clock was found on the floor with a dent in the wooden floor, indicating it was likely moved and damaged during the break-in.

4. The wall clock and the wristwatch were stopped at times after the break-in, suggesting they stopped working after the thief was already in the shop.

5. Ed mentions that the pocket watch is in a display case by the front window, far from the center of the room. This suggests it was not directly affected by the break-in.

6. Since the grandfather clock stopped at 10:10 p.m., which is before the break-in, it's unlikely to be the timepiece that stopped working due to the break-in.

7. The mantle clock stopped at 10:59 p.m., which is also before the break-in. However, considering the damage it sustained, it's possible that the mantle clock stopped working due to the break-in.

8. Given that the mantle clock stopped at 10:59 p.m. and was on the floor with damage, it's likely that the mantle clock stopped working when the thief broke down the door or broke the display case.

9. The police arrested Aubrey Behrens, and Ed can confirm when Behrens was in the shop based on the timepiece that stopped working.

10. The timepiece that stopped working at 10:59 p.m. matches the timeframe of the break-in and the damage sustained by the mantle clock.

Therefore, based on the evidence and the analysis, the guilty person is the one who stopped the mantle clock.

"Analysis:

1.  The timing of Melissa's call to the police is crucial in this case. The coroner estimated that the time of death could be between 7 and 8 pm. However, Melissa claimed to have called the police immediately after Hank's death. This could suggest that Melissa waited an hour to call the police, which might indicate premeditation.
2.  However, the witness, Martha Cranston, testified that it was a quiet and still night, and she heard nothing from the Jones' house around 7 pm. This suggests that there might not have been an intense argument at that time.
3.  Mildred Greene, on the other hand, testified that she heard a big argument going on around 6 pm, with the couple using profanity. She also stated that the argument was still going on an hour and a half later, at 7:30 pm. This testimony seems to contradict Martha Cranston's, suggesting that there was indeed an argument at 7 pm.
4.  Considering the two testimonies, it seems that Mildred Greene is the only witness who places the argument at 7 pm. This could be an attempt to create an alibi for Melissa, as the argument would have been over by the time Hank died, making it seem like Melissa acted in self-defense.
5.  Additionally, Mildred Greene's testimony seems more detailed and vivid compared to Martha Cranston's, which might suggest that Mildred is more invested in the case or has a personal stake in it.
6.  The letter from Maiden Blush to Ask Martha suggests that people can change and that first loves don't always last. This might be a hint at Melissa's relationship with Hank, implying that she might not have been as devoted to him as she claimed.
7.  Considering these points, the most likely suspect is Mildred Greene, as her testimony seems to be the most suspicious and contradictory.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  **Les Nolting's alibi**: Les Nolting was the last one to see the money in his safe when he arrived at 9:00 AM. He then left for a long lunch and returned at 3:00 PM, when he discovered the theft. This means he had an alibi for the time the money went missing, which is around 1:00-1:30 PM.

2.  **Sarah Kimble's alibi**: Sarah Kimble left the office at 1:00 PM to grab a hot takeout lunch and returned around 1:30 PM. This means she also has an alibi for the time the money went missing.

3.  **Paul Brassard's alibi**: Paul Brassard was with Joan Carstairs in the snack room during lunch, but he left for 5 minutes to answer a phone call. During this time, Joan Carstairs was alone. However, it's not clear if this 5-minute window is long enough to commit the crime.

4.  **Joan Carstairs' alibi**: Joan Carstairs was with Paul Brassard in the snack room during lunch, but she left to use the ladies' room when Sarah Kimble returned. This means she had a clear window of opportunity to commit the crime when Paul Brassard left to answer the phone.

5.  **Additional evidence**: The conversation between Sarah Kimble and Crusher Davis reveals that Les Nolting used to buy Joan presents, which made Paul Brassard jealous. However, this information doesn't directly relate to the theft.

6.  **Inspector Samuels' observation**: Inspector Samuels noticed that Sarah Kimble had a crush on Les Nolting, which might suggest that she had a motive to steal the money to get his attention.

However, this observation is not concrete evidence, and it's possible that Sarah Kimble's crush was not a factor in the theft.

7.  **The final clue**: The most telling clue is that Joan Carstairs was alone for 5 minutes during lunch when Paul Brassard left to answer the phone. This is the only clear window of opportunity for one of the suspects to commit the crime.

Based on the analysis, the most likely suspect is **Joan Carstairs**. She had a clear window of opportunity to commit the crime when Paul Brassard left to answer the phone, and she had a motive to steal the money to get Les Nolting's attention away from Paul Brassard.

"To analyze the evidence and solve the mystery, I will carefully examine each piece of information provided.

1.  Erik heard an almost inaudible noise around 1:00 a.m. and saw one of his friends softly open the patio door to go inside. He noticed that the friend's shoes were lighter than the rest of their clothing. This suggests that the person may have been wearing sandals or flip-flops, which are lighter than shoes.

2.  Later, Erik saw a figure step out of the shadows and onto the patio, wearing a white pullover shirt. However, he couldn't identify the person because of the darkness. This person poured a glass of water from the picnic table and drank it, then escaped to the shadows.

3.  At 3:00 a.m., Erik heard a faint rustling noise coming from the patio and saw a shadowy movement. However, he couldn't determine who it was or what the figure was doing. This person was good at being quiet and patient.

4.  Around 4:00 a.m., Erik saw the grayish black outline of his friend creeping along the fence back to his tent. He thought he saw the brief glint of a pair of eyeglasses on this person's forehead. This person went towards the fence gate, exited the backyard, and then re-entered the backyard.

5.  After breakfast, Erik noticed that Martin was wearing a new pair of athletic shoes with grass stains, and Stephen was wearing an expensive sweat suit with a logo.

6.  Erik considered his friends' habits and characteristics. Trevor was a duck hunter, used to long periods of minimal movement and silence when stalking his prey.

Now, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

- The person who went inside the house at 1:00 a.m. wore lighter shoes, which could be sandals or flip-flops. This information alone doesn't point to a specific suspect.

- The person who poured water from the picnic table at 2:00 a.m. wore a white pullover shirt. This information alone also doesn't point to a specific suspect.

- The person who was quiet and patient at 3:00 a.m. and wore eyeglasses at 4:00 a.m. is the same person. This person exited and re-entered the backyard, suggesting they went outside to get something and then returned. The fact that they wore eyeglasses is significant because it rules out two suspects: Trevor and Stephen, who both wear contact lenses.

- The person who exited and re-entered the backyard at 4:00 a.m. wore eyeglasses and was the last one to move around. This suggests that they were the one who pulled the prank.

- Martin's new athletic shoes with grass stains suggest that he may have been the one who exited the backyard at 4:00 a.m. However, this doesn't necessarily mean he was the prankster.

- Stephen's expensive sweat suit is interesting, but it doesn't provide direct evidence of his involvement in the prank.

- Trevor's experience as a duck hunter is a crucial piece of information. The fact that he was quiet and patient at 3:00 a.m. and wore eyeglasses at 4:00 a.m. suggests that he was the one who pulled the prank.

- The fact that Trevor exited and re-entered the backyard at 4:00 a.m. and wore eyeglasses rules out the other two suspects: Justin and Martin.

Based on the analysis, the evidence points to Trevor Sutherland as the guilty person. He was quiet and patient, wore eyeglasses, and was the last one to move around. His experience as a duck hunter also suggests that he was able to remain calm and patient, even in the dead of night.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Initial Investigation**: The police arrive at Gorg's mansion, and upon entering, they notice a peculiar atmosphere. Gorg is emotional, and his wife, Tina, seems intelligent and composed. The police find no signs of forced entry or struggle, suggesting that the thief might have had access to the house.

2. **The Delivery Person**: Lenny orders Chinese food and asks for it to be delivered, which seems like a clever way to interact with Stu, the delivery person. However, this interaction doesn't reveal any concrete evidence, but it does create a relaxed atmosphere, making it harder to discern Stu's intentions.

3. **Insurance and Valuables**: Tina shows the police insurance papers for the guitar, car, house, and gold record. This suggests that she's taking good care of the estate and is aware of the valuables' worth. However, this could be a red herring to make her appear more innocent.

4. **The Empty Den**: Tina explains that she went into the den to check on the gold record after the movie ended, and that's when she discovered it was missing. This seems like a plausible explanation, but it's worth noting that she could have been trying to create an alibi.

5. **The Mysterious Guitar Case**: Lenny's interest in the guitar case, which is covered in diamonds, is a significant detail. The fact that it's on display in the hallway suggests that Gorg values it highly. However, it's unclear if this is a motive for theft.

6. **The Phone Call**: The police receive a phone call from an unknown person, but when they call back, it's Gorg's wife, Tina, who answers. This could imply that she's the one who called, but it's also possible that Gorg or someone else made the call.

7. **The Neighborhood Burglar**: The police receive a profile of the neighborhood burglar, who targets valuable items. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that the burglar is involved in the theft of the gold record, as it could be a separate incident.

8. **Lenny's Investigation Technique**: Lenny's approach to questioning Stu, the delivery person, seems unorthodox, but it does create a relaxed atmosphere. However, it's unclear if this is a genuine attempt to gather information or a ploy to throw off the suspect.

9. **Gorg's Behavior**: Gorg's emotional reaction to the theft of his gold record seems genuine, but it's possible that he's acting to deflect suspicion.

10. **Tina's Behavior**: Tina seems composed and cooperative, but her alibi for the time the gold record went missing is shaky at best.

Considering all the evidence, I notice that the most suspicious behavior is Tina's inconsistent alibi and her lack of reaction to the theft. She claims to have gone into the den to check on the gold record, but she doesn't seem overly concerned about its disappearance. Additionally, she's been managing Gorg's estate and has access to the valuables.

"Analyzing the evidence carefully, I will go through each suspect's alibi and the information provided in their letters to the Ask Martha column.

1. **Scared Stiff**: She claims to have seen the arsonist running out of the front door of Bradley Men's Store on March 11, just after midnight. However, this information is based on a single observation, and she is scared for her safety, which might make her account less reliable. Moreover, there is no evidence linking her to the other fires or the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive.

2. **Watchful Waiter**: He saw a woman climbing the schoolyard wall on two separate occasions, but only made a note of the license plate number the second time. This could be a potential lead, but it doesn't directly link him to the arsons. However, it is worth noting that the arsonist used a different method to start the fires, and the woman's involvement is still speculative.

3. **Keen Observer**: He saw a man in a pickup truck watching the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive. This information is significant because it links him to the location of the fire, but it doesn't necessarily mean he was the arsonist. He could have been an innocent bystander or even a potential witness.

4. **Minding My Own Business**: She has a strong alibi for the time of the Hill's Drug Store fire, as she was with her friend and had just left the store when it caught fire. Her friend could have been an accomplice, but the fact that she didn't recognize the arsonist, even though she had seen him, suggests that she might be telling the truth.

Upon further analysis, I notice that **Watchful Waiter** is the only one who saw someone suspicious (a woman) near the elementary school, which is where the ransom note was dropped off. This could be a crucial piece of evidence. The woman's involvement in the arsons is still speculative, but it's worth investigating further.

However, I also notice that the arsonist used a consistent method for all fires, which involves using rags soaked in kerosene. This method was used for the fires on Main Street and the residential fire on Sunnydale Drive. **Minding My Own Business**'s friend worked at Hill's Drug Store, which was one of the first fires. It's possible that the arsonist used the same method for the other fires, and the fact that **Minding My Own Business**'s friend was at the store when it caught fire suggests that he might have been involved.

Considering all the evidence, I think **Minding My Own Business** is the most likely suspect. She had a friend who worked at the first fire, and her friend could have been an accomplice. The fact that she didn't recognize the arsonist, even though she had seen him, suggests that she might be telling the truth, but it's also possible that she was trying to cover for her friend.

"To solve the mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The medical examiner determines the time of death to be approximately one hour prior to the detectives' arrival, at 1:15. This means that the killer must have left the scene before the detectives arrived.
2.  The computer is identified as the murder weapon, with three blows to the head. This suggests a violent and premeditated act, but also indicates that the killer may have had a personal connection to the victim, as they chose a personal item (the computer) to use as the murder weapon.
3.  The conversation with Claire and Cheryl reveals that they were shopping together from 12:30 to 1:30, with Cheryl leaving to buy Jack a new computer. However, Cheryl claims to have spent the entire hour in the computer store, talking to the clerk. This raises some suspicions about her alibi.
4.  When questioned about visiting her ex-boyfriend, Alex, Cheryl denies it, but Grant suggests that she might have gone to see him. However, the statement from Claire reveals that Alex was already in the house when they returned, suggesting that Cheryl could have indeed visited Alex, but then returned home before the murder.
5.  The fact that Alex had a tooth filling and went to the dentist, which is a plausible explanation for his late arrival, suggests that he might not have had time to commit the crime.
6.  Natalie's alibi is shaky, as she claims to have been with Jack, but Claire disputes this, saying that Jack was cheating on her with Natalie.
7.  When questioned about a flash drive, Alex claims not to have one, which is consistent with his statement that they email their work-in-progress back and forth. However, this doesn't rule out the possibility of him having one elsewhere.
8.  The fact that Natalie is upset about Jack's death and makes a threat against the family members suggests that she might be trying to cover up something.
9.  The key piece of evidence is the fact that Natalie is the only one who didn't have a clear alibi for the time of the murder. While Claire and Cheryl were shopping together, and Alex had a plausible reason for his late arrival, Natalie was supposed to be with Jack, but Claire disputes this.

Based on the evidence, it seems that Natalie's alibi is the weakest, and her reaction to Jack's death is overly dramatic. Given the fact that she was supposed to be with Jack at the time of the murder, but Claire disputes this, and her own alibi is shaky, I believe that Natalie is the most likely suspect.

"To solve this mystery, I'll carefully analyze the evidence provided in the story.

1. **Poison was added to Eddie's coffee**: The key piece of evidence is that the poison was added to Eddie's coffee before it was poured. Watson, who poured the coffee, noticed that one of the cups had an inch of standing water, which he thought would help cool the hot coffee. This suggests that the poison was already in the cup before he poured it.

2. **Who had access to the poison**: The poison was found in a cabinet drawer, which implies that it was not easily concealed. Since Watson and Johnny wore lab coats, they could have easily hidden a bottle in their jackets. Tim, who had on a long-sleeve shirt and jeans, was unlikely to have hidden the poison in his clothing. Ray, who had on a short-sleeve shirt and slacks, was also unlikely to have hidden the poison in his clothing.

3. **Who served the coffee**: Johnny brought the coffee over to the table and asked everyone to take a cup from the tray. Eddie was the last one served, which means that the poison was added to his coffee after it was poured.

4. **The killer's opportunity**: The distraction caused by the news of President Reagan's shooting provided the perfect opportunity for the killer to add the poison to Eddie's coffee.

Considering these points, we can now analyze the alibis of the suspects:

- **Al Gibson**: Al was already at the table before the coffee was poured, which means he could not have added the poison to Eddie's coffee.
- **Johnny Woodward**: Johnny brought the coffee over to the table and asked everyone to take a cup from the tray. He also had a motive to kill Eddie, as he was the one who covered up the crime for 27 years. However, Johnny's alibi is shaky, as he could have easily added the poison to Eddie's coffee while serving it.
- **Ray Shields**: Ray had on a short-sleeve shirt and slacks, which makes it unlikely that he hid the poison in his clothing. He also didn't have a clear opportunity to add the poison to Eddie's coffee.
- **Tim Acord**: Tim had on a long-sleeve shirt and jeans, which makes it unlikely that he hid the poison in his clothing. He also didn't have a clear opportunity to add the poison to Eddie's coffee.
- **Watson Treadway**: Watson poured the coffee and noticed that one of the cups had an inch of standing water. However, he didn't serve the coffee, and the poison was already in the cup when he poured it.

Based on the analysis, the most likely suspect is **Johnny Woodward**. His alibi is shaky, and he had a motive to kill Eddie. He was the one who served the coffee and had the opportunity to add the poison to Eddie's cup.",Unknown,Johnny Woodward,159
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The first letter from Concerned Neighbor suggests that the littering problem is widespread and deliberate. However, there is no direct evidence linking them to the crime.
2.  Smug in Suburbia also believes the problem is widespread and deliberate, but his solution is to hire more police. His gated community has security, which suggests he may have a vested interest in the community association dues, but this doesn't directly implicate him in the crime.
3.  Perplexed Dog Walker provides the most direct evidence of the crime, as she witnessed the littering happening from a car's front window. However, she didn't get a good look at the car, and there's no direct evidence linking her to the crime.
4.  The fourth letter from Confused Commuter seems to provide a crucial piece of evidence. He claims to have seen someone stealing a garbage container behind a fast food restaurant, which could be connected to the littering problem. However, there's no direct evidence linking him to the crime.

Now, let's examine the details of the letters:

- Concerned Neighbor and Smug in Suburbia both wrote letters to the advice column without any apparent concern about being seen as the litterer. This suggests they may be innocent.
- Perplexed Dog Walker wrote a handwritten letter, which could be a red flag if she's trying to cover her tracks.
- Confused Commuter also wrote a handwritten letter, but he claimed to have seen someone else stealing a garbage container. This could be a genuine attempt to report a crime, but it's also possible he's trying to mislead the detective.

Considering the details, I notice that the handwriting of Perplexed Dog Walker and Confused Commuter is described as handwritten, whereas Concerned Neighbor and Smug in Suburbia's letters are not mentioned as handwritten. This could be a coincidence, but it's an interesting detail.

Furthermore, Perplexed Dog Walker's letter mentions that she saw the littering happen along Elm as it leads into Maple, which is the same street where Concerned Neighbor lives. This could be a coincidence, but it's a suspicious connection.

However, the most compelling evidence comes from the fact that Confused Commuter's story about seeing someone stealing a garbage container behind a fast food restaurant seems too convenient. If he's trying to mislead the detective, he's doing a good job, but it's still suspicious.

Considering all the evidence, I think the most likely suspect is Perplexed Dog Walker. She's the only one who saw the littering happen, and her connection to Concerned Neighbor's street is suspicious. Her handwritten letter could be a red flag, and her suggestion of forming a community association to patrol the area could be a way to cover her tracks.

"To solve this mystery, I'll analyze the evidence step by step.

**Step 1: Motive**

Looking at the suspects, we can see that Isabelle Rogers has a clear motive to sabotage Rebecca's car. Isabelle was upset when she found out she didn't get the part of Maggie, and she even threatened Rebecca earlier. This suggests that Isabelle has a strong motive to harm Rebecca and disrupt the play.

James Fennimore also has a motive, but it's more indirect. He's unhappy with Rebecca getting the part, but he doesn't seem to have a direct personal stake in the play's outcome. James's outburst and threats are more about his own ego and pride.

Alfred Cooper and Madge Anderson seem to have less direct motives. Alfred Cooper is concerned about the play's success, but he's also invested in Rebecca's talent and has encouraged her to take the role. Madge Anderson is more concerned about James's potential departure from the play.

**Step 2: Opportunity**

Looking at the suspects' opportunities to sabotage Rebecca's car, we can see that Isabelle Rogers had a clear opportunity to do so. She was working at the bakery, which is nearby the theater where Rebecca parks her car. She could have easily taken a break and gone to the parking lot to sabotage Rebecca's car.

James Fennimore also had an opportunity, but it's less likely. He works at a body shop, which is also nearby, but he would have had to take time off work to sabotage Rebecca's car.

Alfred Cooper and Madge Anderson seem to have less opportunity to sabotage Rebecca's car. They were at the theater during rehearsals, but they wouldn't have had a chance to sabotage the car.

**Step 3: Means**

Considering the means to sabotage Rebecca's car, we can see that Isabelle Rogers would have had the means to do so. She could have used her knowledge of the bakery's tools or her own mechanical skills to disconnect the battery.

James Fennimore also has the means, but it's less likely. He works at a body shop, which might give him access to tools, but he would have had to take time off work to sabotage Rebecca's car.

Alfred Cooper and Madge Anderson seem to have less means to sabotage Rebecca's car. They wouldn't have had access to the necessary tools or knowledge to do so.

**Conclusion**

Based on the evidence, Isabelle Rogers had the motive, opportunity, and means to sabotage Rebecca's car. Her angry outburst and threats earlier in the story suggest that she had a strong motive to harm Rebecca. Her opportunity to sabotage the car was also clear, given her proximity to the theater and the parking lot. Finally, her knowledge of the bakery's tools and her own mechanical skills suggest that she had the means to do so.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Initial Analysis**: The key to this case is understanding the service procedure at The Blue Parrot Restaurant. According to Georges Monceau, the headwaiter, the headwaiter delivers the menus, offers assistance, and sometimes takes orders. Antoine, the waiter, gives the order to the chef and serves the food. Sam Wheeler, the chef, cooks the food to order, never preparing it in advance. Sally Horvats, the hostess and cashier, seats customers and handles the front desk.

2. **Sam Wheeler's Account**: Sam Wheeler claims that he cooks truffles to order and never prepares them in advance. He also mentions that he had never cooked truffles before, only seen it done in culinary school. This raises a red flag, as it's unlikely that a chef with no experience would be trusted to handle such a valuable and delicate ingredient.

3. **Truffle Jar**: The jar of truffles is still half-full, with only six orders having been made from it. Given that Sam Wheeler claims to cook truffles to order and that each jar can make about six orders, it's likely that the truffles were prepared in advance and stored in the jar, rather than cooked on the spot.

4. **Sally Horvats' Nervous Behavior**: Sally Horvats seems nervous and fidgety when questioned about the incident. This behavior could indicate that she is hiding something or is guilty of the crime.

5. **The Credit Card Receipts**: The credit card receipts show six orders of truffled steaks for last week, including the order for the Saunders luncheon. However, only three orders were made today. This discrepancy suggests that the truffles were prepared in advance and sold as part of a different order.

6. **Motivation**: Sally Horvats is on parole for petty larceny and has been working at The Blue Parrot for only six months. She may have seen an opportunity to steal from the restaurant and take advantage of the truffle orders to do so.

7. **Conclusion**: Based on the evidence, it's likely that Sally Horvats switched the orders and stole the truffles. She had the opportunity to do so, given her position as hostess and cashier. Her nervous behavior and the discrepancy in the credit card receipts suggest that she is guilty of grand larceny.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The police detective suspects that the thieves probably cased Uncle Ezra's store the day before the crime. This suggests that the thieves were familiar with the store's layout and might have been planning the heist in advance.

2.  Uncle Ezra leaves his most valuable books locked in a closet in the back of the store, except for the signed first edition of ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" that he keeps under a glass cover next to the cash register. This suggests that he values this particular book highly and might be particularly attached to it.

3.  The police officer leaves the store, and Uncle Ezra reveals that a decoy book was stolen. He had hidden a transmitter tag in the spine of the decoy book and given the police a receiver to track the thief. This indicates that Uncle Ezra is clever and might be playing a game with the police.

4.  When searching for Cupcake, the group looks around the store but can't find the cat. However, when they finally find Cupcake in the basement, he is wearing a tiny blue wizard's hat. This seems like a lighthearted moment, but it also shows that Uncle Ezra might be prone to pranks and might be trying to distract the group.

5.  Later, when the real Harry Potter book is stolen, Uncle Ezra becomes frantic. He looks suspiciously at Rusty and Ann, suggesting that he might be thinking that one of them could have stolen the book.

6.  The police eventually arrest a surly loner who wanted to sell the book to buy a car. However, this doesn't help Uncle Ezra recover his stolen book.

7.  A package arrives at the store with the stolen book, and there's a handwritten note apologizing for stealing the book and asking Uncle Ezra not to call the police. This suggests that the thief is someone who knows Uncle Ezra and is trying to cover their tracks.

Now, let's analyze the suspects:

-   **Alfred**: While Alfred was nailing up the plywood when the book disappeared, this doesn't necessarily implicate him in the theft. However, it's an interesting coincidence.

-   **Ann**: Ann seems like a suspicious character, as she's been acting uninterested in Uncle Ezra's rare book, and Rusty suspects she's jealous. However, there's no concrete evidence linking her to the theft.

-   **Rusty**: Rusty is a fan of the Harry Potter series and seems genuinely upset when the store is broken into. However, he's also been searching for Cupcake and could have had the opportunity to steal the book while everyone was distracted.

-   **Uncle Ezra**: Uncle Ezra is a master of pranks and has been playing a game with the police. However, this doesn't necessarily mean he's guilty of theft. On the other hand, his behavior seems suspicious, especially when he's looking at Rusty and Ann with suspicion.

Given the evidence, it seems that Uncle Ezra is trying to distract the group and cover his tracks. He's a master of pranks, and his behavior is suspicious. However, there's one crucial piece of evidence that points to the true culprit:

The note in the package says ""Sorry I stole your book,"" which suggests that the thief is someone who knows Uncle Ezra personally and is trying to cover their tracks. Considering the note's tone and the fact that Uncle Ezra is trying to distract the group, it's likely that the thief is someone who is close to Uncle Ezra and can easily access his store.

The only person who fits this description is Uncle Ezra himself. He's been trying to distract the group and cover his tracks, and the note in the package suggests that he's the one who stole his own book.",Unknown,Uncle Ezra,163
"To determine who is guilty, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The crime occurred between 7:13 (when the rain started) and 7:51 (when Megan Brewer found the body). During this time, Cynthia Peck was in her car, except for a short time she spent in her apartment retrieving a contract. She claims to have made several cell phone calls from her car, including one around 7:10, 7:35, and after 8:00.

   However, if Cynthia was in her car the entire time, her cell phone would not be able to make calls from a long distance. This suggests that Cynthia may have been near the Ames building during the time of the murder.

2.  Megan Brewer claims not to know how Trent Willis got to the sixth floor and into the office. However, the security records show that she was on the sixth floor at 6:59, which is close to the time when Cynthia left the elevator at 6:45. This raises the possibility that Megan could have let Trent Willis into the office.

3.  Josh Kesler arrived at 7:25 and claims to have seen nothing out of the ordinary. However, he does not have a raincoat, but he has an umbrella that he says is drying in his office. This is unusual because he would likely have used the umbrella to stay dry during the rain.

4.  Steve Ledbetter, the president of the company, has a car and driver at his disposal. He claims that his driver lets him out right at the front door, so he never wears a raincoat. However, this is not a strong alibi because it is possible that he could have walked around to the side of the building and entered the office without being seen.

Based on these points, the evidence suggests that Megan Brewer is the most likely suspect. She was on the sixth floor close to the time when Cynthia left the elevator, and her alibi for the time of the murder is weak. Additionally, her reaction to the news of the murder was to weep, which may be a sign of guilt.

"Let's analyze the evidence carefully:

1.  The ring that was stolen was a paste copy, which was left in the vault, and the real ring was left in the jewelry case with the other gems. This indicates that the thief knew about the Majeska collection and the layout of the vault.
2.  All four suspects (Alan Harrison, Evelyn Johnston, George Smythe, and Herbert Grosvenor) are on the list of guests at the Majeska ball who were personal friends of the Ambassador and his wife. This suggests that they all had access to the private quarters where the jewelry was kept.
3.  Each of the four suspects pawned a ring with a similar description (""jeweled ring"") and received a similar amount of money for it. This suggests that they were trying to pawn off their own jewelry without drawing attention to themselves.
4.  The stories they told to pawn their rings are suspicious:
    *   George Smythe claimed his ring had been in his family for generations and was worn by his grandmother when she was presented at Court. This is a plausible story, but it doesn't explain why he would pawn the ring.
    *   Alan Harrison claimed he won the ring at cards that morning and needed cash to pay off bills. This is a common reason for pawning jewelry, but it doesn't explain why he would pawn a valuable ring.
    *   Evelyn Johnston claimed she was left the ring by her cousin and wanted to pawn it because someone might recognize it at the Majeska Ball. This story is suspicious because it's unlikely that she would pawn the ring if it was a family heirloom.
    *   Herbert Grosvenor claimed the ring was new and bought for a lady he planned to propose to, but she rejected him and he didn't want to keep it. This story is suspicious because it's an unlikely reason for pawning a valuable ring, and it's also suspicious that he would pawn the ring immediately after the rejection.
5.  Sam Jurgens, the clerk, mentioned that Herbert Grosvenor was a sad and solemn man who seemed to be looking for someone to talk to. This suggests that Herbert Grosvenor was trying to make a good impression on the clerk, which could be a sign of guilt.
6.  Sam Jurgens also mentioned that Herbert Grosvenor said the ring had brought him ""terrible luck"" and that he wasn't sure if he would bother picking it up again. This is a suspicious comment, as it implies that Herbert Grosvenor had a personal connection to the ring and was trying to downplay its significance.

Considering all the evidence, the most suspicious suspect is Herbert Grosvenor. His story about the ring being a new purchase for a lady he planned to propose to seems unlikely, and his comment about the ring bringing him ""terrible luck"" suggests that he had a personal connection to the ring. Additionally, his behavior of pawning the ring immediately after the rejection implies that he was trying to get rid of the ring quickly.",Unknown,Alan Harrison,165
"Let's analyze the evidence carefully:

1. **The discovery of the banana grove**: Grog discovers a banana grove and shares the news with his family. This event sets the stage for the rest of the story.

2. **The disappearance of the bananas**: The next morning, Grog returns to the grove to find that all the bananas are gone. The trail of the club is erased, and there are cracked branches everywhere.

3. **The behavior of Droo**: Droo is jealous of Grog's discovery and is seen eyeing the bananas. He also throws a banana peel at Grog, but Grog ignores him.

4. **Grog's suspicion of Droo**: Grog suspects that Droo might have hidden the bananas, but it's not a strong suspicion since Droo didn't seem to have the opportunity to hide them.

5. **Grog's suspicion of his father**: Grog thinks that his father might have hidden the bananas to prevent him from crossing the field. This is a plausible motive, given his father's concern for their safety.

6. **Grog's mother's behavior**: Grog's mother seems to be unhappy about the disappearance of the bananas, but she doesn't say anything.

7. **The absence of other suspects**: There is no evidence to suggest that the dinosaur or the monkeys were involved in the disappearance of the bananas.

Now, let's analyze the motives and opportunities of each suspect:

- **Dinosaur**: There is no motive for the dinosaur to hide the bananas. It's not a plausible suspect.
- **Droo**: While Droo is jealous of Grog's discovery, there is no clear motive for him to hide the bananas. He could have easily eaten them or taken some for himself, but hiding them all is not a logical action.
- **Father**: Grog's father has a clear motive to hide the bananas. He is concerned about Grog's safety and wants to prevent him from crossing the field. This is a strong motive for him to hide the bananas.
- **Monkeys**: There is no evidence to suggest that the monkeys were involved in the disappearance of the bananas.

Considering the evidence and the motives, the most plausible suspect is Grog's father. He has a clear motive to hide the bananas, and his behavior is consistent with that motive.

2.  When Tim asked where Larry and David were, Donna replied that she didn't know, but later, they walked in wearing swim trunks and goggles. This discrepancy in their alibi makes me suspicious.
3.  Larry claimed to have gone outside with David, but David said he had to rinse off his flippers. However, Larry's new white t-shirt with package wrinkles suggests that he had just changed into it, not gone outside with David.
4.  When Tim commented on Larry's new t-shirt, Larry didn't deny it, which further raises suspicions about his alibi.
5.  The fact that Tim's car was moved out of sight without him hearing it start up suggests that it was pushed, not driven away. This, combined with the fact that the car is small and lightweight, makes it plausible that one person could have rolled it downhill and around the block.
6.  Donna was the only one who seemed genuinely eager to go swimming, and she was the one who commented on being ready for swimming. This eagerness, combined with her suspicious behavior earlier, makes me suspect that she might be involved.
7.  When Tim said, ""It looks like you are ready for swimming, and I know who moved my car,"" he seemed to be hinting that he had figured out who was guilty. Given the context, it's likely that he's accusing Donna.

1. The gun used to kill Stella Marlowe was registered to Arthur Glendon, and he claimed to have lent it to Linda Eberlie for a previous show. However, Linda Eberlie returned the gun to Glendon after the show, and Glendon claimed he had not seen it since then. However, it's possible that Glendon could have taken the gun back from Linda Eberlie and hidden it, or that someone else could have stolen it from him.

2. Sam Watson, the actor who fired the gun, seemed genuinely shocked and distraught about the event. However, he also seemed to have an alibi for the time of the murder, as he was on stage at the time of the shooting. He also mentioned that he didn't own a gun, but he was a hunter and enjoyed fly-fishing.

3. Josh Whitehead, the actor who was in a relationship with Stella Marlowe, seemed to have a motive to kill her, as she had broken up with him for Sam Watson. However, he claimed to have been in New York at the time of the murder, and he didn't know how to buy a gun.

4. Linda Eberlie, the prop master, seemed to have a motive to kill Stella Marlowe, as she was in a relationship with Sam Watson and Stella had been stealing him from her. She also seemed to have an alibi for the time of the murder, as she was in her dressing room at the time of the shooting.

5. Stella Marlowe's dressing room was a shrine to herself, and it seemed to be a reflection of her narcissistic personality. However, this doesn't necessarily implicate her in the murder.

6. The fact that the gun used to kill Stella Marlowe was heavier than the prop gun suggests that it was the real gun, and not the prop gun.

Now, let's look at the statements from the suspects:

- Arthur Glendon's story about lending the gun to Linda Eberlie and not seeing it since then seems suspicious, but it's possible that he could have taken the gun back from Linda Eberlie or that someone else stole it from him.
- Sam Watson's story seems genuine, but he was the one who fired the gun, which raises questions about his involvement.
- Josh Whitehead's story seems suspicious, as he claimed to have been in New York at the time of the murder, but the police investigation didn't verify this.
- Linda Eberlie's story seems suspicious, as she seemed to have a motive to kill Stella Marlowe, and she seemed to have an alibi for the time of the murder.

Based on the evidence, I think Linda Eberlie is the most likely suspect. She seemed to have a motive to kill Stella Marlowe, and her story about returning the gun to Arthur Glendon seems suspicious. However, the key piece of evidence that points to her guilt is the fact that she seemed to have been in her dressing room at the time of the murder, which would have given her the opportunity to switch the guns. Additionally, her statement about Stella Marlowe switching the real gun with the prop gun seems like a red herring, as it's unlikely that Stella Marlowe would have had the opportunity to do so.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and provide a step-by-step reasoning.

Step 1: Identify the key events and statements from the witnesses.

- Jane Landau's iPod went missing during second block.
- Jane mentioned that she had a free period and was the only one who could have taken her iPod by accident due to the unique stickers and her name on the back.
- Shay Dulaney was sitting behind Jane and watched Rachel Vermeer and Lea Thompson discussing something in front of her.
- Shawn Ramos was sitting next to Shay and claimed to have been distracted by Rachel's conversation with Lea.
- Lea Thompson was called down to the office a few minutes before class ended.
- Rachel Vermeer was visibly annoyed and claimed to have been working after Lea left the classroom.
- Rachel was walking in to Room 106 with Lea Thompson when they were called to speak with Mrs. Adam.

Step 2: Analyze the alibis and inconsistencies in the statements.

- Shay Dulaney seemed bored and uninterested in the conversation, but her alibi checks out as she was reading her iPod during the time the theft occurred.
- Shawn Ramos claimed to have been distracted by Rachel's conversation, but this doesn't necessarily mean he was not paying attention to Jane's iPod.
- Lea Thompson has a solid alibi as she was called down to the office a few minutes before class ended.
- Rachel Vermeer's alibi is shaky, as she claims to have been working after Lea left the classroom, but her behavior seems suspicious as she was visibly annoyed and her purse was tightly held against her side.

Step 3: Look for any additional clues or inconsistencies that could point to the guilty person.

- Rachel Vermeer's reaction to being called to Room 106, combined with her holding her purse tightly against her side, raises suspicions. This could indicate that she was trying to hide something.
- The fact that Rachel was walking in with Lea Thompson, who had a solid alibi, may suggest that Rachel was trying to use Lea as a distraction or an alibi.
- Lea Thompson's alibi checks out, but her presence with Rachel Vermeer may be a coincidence.

Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the evidence and reasoning.

Considering the inconsistencies in Rachel Vermeer's alibi, her suspicious behavior, and the fact that she was walking in with Lea Thompson, I believe that Rachel Vermeer is the most likely suspect. The evidence suggests that she may have stolen Jane's iPod and was trying to cover her tracks.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence carefully.

1. **Timeline of Events:**
   - The events of the story take place on a Saturday, starting with the Fall Festival and the wrestling tournament, and ending with the dance.
   - The dance starts at 9:00 p.m. and goes on until 1:00 a.m.
   - The punch was spiked before the dance, as everyone who had the punch got sick, but the narrator had a cup of punch before anyone else and did not get sick.

2. **Key Evidence:**
   - The narrator had a cup of punch before anyone else, but did not get sick.
   - Principal Whittenmeyer guarded the door and gave out Breathalyzers to test for alcohol, but did not get sick.
   - Dan, Diane, and Carole all got sick after drinking the punch.
   - Dan was by the punch bowl a lot, helping his friends and talking to them.
   - Diane was passing out punch to everyone.
   - Carole arrived alone and did not get a chance to drink much punch before she got sick.

3. **Analysis of Suspects:**
   - **Principal Whittenmeyer:** As the guardian of the door and the person in charge of the Breathalyzers, it would be suspicious if he spiked the punch. However, he did not get sick, which contradicts this theory.
   - **Carole:** Carole arrived alone and did not have much opportunity to drink the punch. Since she got sick, it's unlikely that she spiked the punch herself.
   - **Diane:** Diane was passing out punch to everyone. However, if she spiked the punch, she would also have gotten sick, which contradicts the evidence.
   - **Dan:** Dan was by the punch bowl a lot, helping his friends and talking to them. This suggests that he had a lot of opportunities to tamper with the punch. He also didn't get sick, which is consistent with the theory that he spiked the punch.

4. **Conclusion:**
   Based on the evidence, the only suspect who had the opportunity to spike the punch without getting sick is Dan. The fact that he was by the punch bowl a lot, and the fact that he did not get sick, makes him the most likely suspect.

"Analysis:

1.  The first step is to identify the discrepancy in the theater's finances. Arthur Glendon noticed that the bills for the power company and the caterer were not paid in full, resulting in a carry-over balance of $400.
2.  Basil Carmody, the accountant, assured Glendon that he has never known Martha Gilmont, the cashier, to make a mistake in counting the receipts. However, Basil Carmody does not have access to the company checkbook.
3.  John Franklin, the Treasurer, admitted to not paying the bills in full last month, but claimed it was due to a lack of funds.
4.  Lawrence Blake, the Head Teller at the Vermont Enterprise Bank, confirmed that Basil Carmody deposits the receipts on Monday mornings and that John Franklin signs the checks.
5.  Martha Gilmont mentioned that she locks the outside door of the box office after the performance and then goes to do the receipts. She also stated that she double and triple checks everything.
6.  The key piece of evidence is that the discount coupons presented at the box office are xerox copies, not originals. This suggests that someone is creating fake coupons to redeem for discounts.
7.  Since Basil Carmody is the one who signs the receipts with Martha Gilmont, it is likely that he is the one who is creating the fake coupons. He has access to the box office and is the only one who sees the coupons before they are counted.
8.  The fact that Basil Carmody is the one who signs the receipts and is the only one who sees the coupons before they are counted, makes him the most likely suspect.
9.  Additionally, Basil Carmody's calm demeanor and lack of concern when questioned by Glendon suggests that he may be hiding something.
10. The fact that John Franklin, the Treasurer, was not aware of the discrepancy in the finances and was not involved in creating the fake coupons, makes him less likely to be the culprit.
11. Lawrence Blake, the Head Teller, does not have any reason to create fake coupons, and Martha Gilmont's method of counting the receipts and locking the door after the performance makes it unlikely that she is the one creating the fake coupons.

Conclusion:
Based on the evidence and analysis, the most likely suspect is Basil Carmody. He has access to the box office, signs the receipts with Martha Gilmont, and is the only one who sees the coupons before they are counted. His calm demeanor and lack of concern when questioned by Glendon also suggest that he may be hiding something.

"To determine who is guilty, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The old man seemed to be avoiding eye contact with Waffle Man, which could suggest that he is hiding something or doesn't want to interact with Waffle Man. However, this behavior alone is not enough to implicate him in the crime.

2.  The old man tells a story about Waffle Man's origin, which includes the incident where Waffle Man became a local celebrity for stopping a robbery. This story seems genuine, but it also raises a question: why would the old man be grumbling about Waffle Man solving crimes if he were the actual perpetrator?

3.  Vera seems annoyed with Waffle Man and doesn't seem to think much of his abilities. However, her behavior towards Waffle Man could be due to her personal feelings towards him rather than any involvement in the crime.

4.  When Vera asks if anyone has been sitting at the counter besides the three of them, she becomes excited and accuses the old man of being involved in the theft. However, this reaction seems genuine, as she is clearly concerned about the missing money.

5.  Waffle Man's theory that Larry might have taken the money seems melodramatic, but it also raises a red flag. Larry was eating quietly after Waffle Man's accusation, and it was revealed that he had been stealing food from the narrator's plate. This behavior suggests that Larry might be capable of stealing.

6.  The narrator also mentions that Larry was glad for some conversation with the old man, which could indicate that Larry was trying to distract the old man while he committed the crime.

Considering these points, the evidence suggests that Larry is the most likely perpetrator. His behavior of stealing food from the narrator's plate and his quiet eating after Waffle Man's accusation imply that he might be capable of stealing. Additionally, his interest in conversing with the old man could have been a distraction to commit the crime. The other suspects' behaviors seem less suspicious, and Vera's reaction to the missing money seems genuine.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and follow the clues step by step.

1.  Juliet noticed that the total amount in the offering envelope was $6.10, which included five one-dollar bills, four quarters, and one dime. This indicates that the secret tither contributed a 10% tithe, which is $1.10.
2.  James Gant claimed that the four quarters in the envelope were the only coins in his pocket. However, since there is a dime in the envelope, it is clear that James is not telling the truth, as he would have had to have a dime in his pocket as well.
3.  Judy Gant said she had a pencil in her hand when the envelope was being passed around, and she also claimed she didn't have any coins in her skirt pocket. This eliminates her as the secret tither.
4.  Ellie Wilson had her handbag with her, and she claimed she only had a dollar in the offering. However, her handbag was full of various items, and she didn't produce the extra coins. This is suspicious, as it's likely she could have hidden the coins in her handbag. However, there is no direct evidence linking her to the secret tithing.
5.  Waylon Marsh claimed he had only nickels and pennies in his pocket. Since the secret tither contributed a dime, which is not a nickel or a penny, Waylon's alibi is not valid.
6.  Doc Bentson was the only person who didn't claim to have any coins in his pocket, but this doesn't necessarily mean he's the secret tither. However, it's a crucial piece of information to consider.
7.  Juliet, as a former agent of the state Bureau of Investigation, is a skilled observer and interviewer. She noticed that Doc placed a dollar bill into the envelope, but she didn't notice anything else out of the ordinary. This suggests that Doc might not have been paying attention to the envelope when he put in his dollar.
8.  Juliet then asked to see Waylon's wallet, which was a nice leather wallet with various compartments. This suggests that Waylon might be hiding something, but Juliet didn't find any direct evidence of the secret tithing in the wallet.
9.  Juliet then asked Waylon if he had coins in his pocket, and he said yes, but only nickels and pennies. However, as we established earlier, the secret tither contributed a dime, which is not a nickel or a penny.
10.  Juliet's final question to Waylon was a compliment about his wallet, which was a clever way to distract him and create a moment of pause. This pause was crucial, as it allowed Juliet to think about the evidence and make a conclusion.

Based on the evidence and the analysis, the most likely suspect is:

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The play ""All's Right, Now That You're Here"" has a plot that involves sabotaging the competition to get the lead role. This sets the tone for the tryouts, where each actress suspects the others of sabotaging them.
2.  The actresses all suspect each other of sabotaging their drinks, but only Sandra Buckingham accuses someone specifically - Alice Cartwright. Sandra claims that her drink had vinegar in it, which made it difficult for her to perform.
3.  However, it's revealed later that the drink had actually been tampered with, and the tampering was done to make it seem like it was the other actresses who had sabotaged it. This is an important clue, as it suggests that the person who tampered with the drink is trying to mislead others.
4.  Janice Starling is the only one who is not accused of sabotaging anyone's drink, but she is accused of being late to the tryout. However, she provides a reasonable explanation for her tardiness, and her performance is excellent.
5.  Alice Cartwright's performance is also excellent, but she is not accused of sabotaging anyone's drink. However, she does seem to be on the defensive when Sandra accuses her of sabotaging her drink.
6.  Arthur Glendon seems to be playing a clever game, using the actresses' suspicions against them. He's the one who is trying to manipulate the situation to his advantage.
7.  Rex Lansford, the veteran star, seems to be the one who knows the truth behind the sabotage. He says, ""I know what happened, and who is responsible for this very odd and untraditional tryout.""
8.  The key to solving the mystery lies in the fact that Rex Lansford knows the truth. He's the one who is in a position to know what's going on, and he's the one who has the most to gain from the sabotage.

Considering all the evidence, the person who is most likely to be responsible for the sabotage is Arthur Glendon. He's the one who is manipulating the situation, and he's the one who has the most to gain from the sabotage. The other actresses are all trying to get the lead role, but Arthur has a different motive. He's not trying to get the lead role for himself, but rather to create a situation where he can choose the winner based on his own criteria.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence provided by each suspect and look for inconsistencies or clues that might point to the guilty party.

1. Larry Brooks: Larry claimed that his family was in Mexico during the 1930s, which seems like a plausible alibi. However, Patrick's question about the ""War of the Worlds"" radio broadcast on October 30, 1938, suggests that Larry might not have been in Mexico at that time. Larry confirmed that he remembered the date of the broadcast, which implies that he was likely in the United States during that period. This raises suspicions about Larry's alibi.

2. Lester Barton: Lester provided a detailed account of his family's life during the 1930s, including his father's work as a milk and ice wagon driver in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. He also mentioned being with his father on most nights, but not on the night of the ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast. However, when asked about the date of the broadcast, Lester confirmed it was October 30, 1938, which suggests that he was not the bank robber. His alibi seems solid.

3. Oscar Jordan: Oscar's story about being laid up in bed with tuberculosis and later contracting polio seems like a convincing explanation for his lack of involvement in any bank robberies. However, Patrick's question about the mounted infantry and Edward's response implies that Oscar's physical limitations might not have been as severe as he claimed. Additionally, Oscar's dry response to Patrick's question about the depression years might suggest that he is hiding something.

4. Edward Cantrell: Edward's response to the question about the mounted infantry and his ability to ride a horse is not particularly revealing. However, when asked about his branch of service, he proudly mentioned being a tank officer and knowing General Patton. This information is not directly relevant to the question of whether he was a bank robber. However, it implies that Edward was a high-ranking officer in the US Army, which might have given him access to resources and opportunities that could have been used to fund a life of crime.

Considering the evidence, I notice that Edward's responses seem the most evasive and unrelated to the question at hand. His ability to ride a horse and his military background do not provide a clear alibi or explanation for his activities during the 1930s. In contrast, Larry's alibi seems shaky, but not entirely implausible. Lester's alibi is solid, and Oscar's story, while suspicious, does not provide concrete evidence of his guilt.

Based on the analysis, I conclude that Edward Cantrell is the most likely suspect. His evasive responses and lack of a clear alibi make him the most suspicious of the group.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence carefully and follow the events as they unfold.

1.  The story starts with Debra introducing the narrator to her father's friends, who are members of ""The Liar's Club."" They seem to be a group of people who enjoy telling lies and playing a mysterious game. This suggests that they are all experienced liars.
2.  When the narrator sees the banner that reads ""The Liar's Club,"" they realize that everything they've been told is a lie. This is a crucial clue, as it implies that the group's behavior and statements are not to be trusted.
3.  The narrator notices that the butler is carrying a large glass bowl of punch, but they are wearing gloves, which makes it difficult for them to hold onto the bowl. This could be a hint at the butler's involvement in the theft, as they might be trying to leave fingerprints or other evidence behind.
4.  When the lights go out, and the dice are stolen, the group's reactions are suspicious. Olivia and Luke both claim to have seen perfectly in the dark, which is unlikely. This could be a red herring to distract from their true involvement.
5.  Debra's father tells the sentimental story behind the dice, which seems genuine. However, it's possible that this is just another lie to manipulate the group's emotions.
6.  When Debra's father accuses the group of stealing his uncle's dice, they all claim responsibility, which is a clear indication that they are not telling the truth.
7.  The lack of physical evidence, such as footprints or fingerprints, does not necessarily rule out the butler's involvement, as they could have been careful to avoid leaving a trail.
8.  The fact that Debra's father breaks the rules by telling the truth and expressing his frustration with the game suggests that he might be a more genuine person than the others.
9.  Considering the group's behavior and the lack of physical evidence, it's likely that the thief is one of the group members who is experienced in deception.

Based on the analysis, the most likely culprit is Debra. Here's why:

*   Debra's father breaks the rules by telling the truth, which suggests that Debra might be the one who has been controlling his behavior.
*   Debra seems to be the one who is most comfortable with the group's behavior and games, which implies that she might be the one who is in control.
*   The fact that Debra is not accused by her father, despite being the one who introduced the narrator to the group, suggests that she might be the mastermind behind the theft.

"Analysis of the evidence:

1. **Access to the stage**: All four actresses had access to the stage, but the key to the trapdoor was not mentioned to be in anyone's possession. However, it's possible that someone could have accessed the lower stairs to bolt the trapdoor from below.
2. **The yardstick**: A yardstick was found snapped in half near the trapdoor. This suggests that someone used it to brace the trapdoor, which would have given way under anyone's weight, resulting in a fall. This is a crucial piece of evidence, as it indicates that the accident was not an accident at all, but rather a setup.
3. **Lack of alibis**: The four actresses (Grace Upshaw, Linda Grant, Molly Trumbull, and Samantha Powers) each had separate dressing rooms, which means they didn't have an alibi for the start of Act Three. This makes it difficult to determine who was in the area where the trapdoor was located.
4. **Samantha Powers' behavior**: Samantha was chosen as understudy to Grace Upshaw for the Mrs. Danvers role. This means that Samantha would have had access to the stage and the props area, including the yardstick. Additionally, she finished Act Three after Grace Upshaw's ""accident,"" which suggests that she was prepared to take over the role.
5. **Molly Trumbull's seething resentment**: Molly was upset about being passed over for the maid role and felt that the casting was unfair. This resentment could have motivated her to sabotage the play.
6. **Lack of motive for Linda Grant**: Linda Grant and Grace Upshaw had a long-standing dislike for each other, but there's no indication that Linda would benefit from Grace's ""accident."" Linda was already cast as the second Mrs. de Winter, and Grace's injury wouldn't have given her an advantage in the play.

Considering the evidence, I believe that the most likely culprit is:

GUILTY: Samantha Powers

My reasoning is as follows: Samantha had access to the stage and the props area, including the yardstick. She was chosen as understudy to Grace Upshaw, which suggests that she was prepared to take over the role of Mrs. Danvers. Her behavior after the ""accident"" was calm and collected, which is unusual given the circumstances. While Molly Trumbull's resentment is a strong motive, there's no direct evidence linking her to the crime. Linda Grant's lack of motive and Grace Upshaw's own determination to continue playing her part make them less likely suspects.",Samantha Powers,Grace Upshaw,177
"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and reasoning step by step.

1.  The little black-haired girl claims to be visiting her sick grandmother in the United States with her parents. She says she brought the Canadian money to change into American currency for presents. She correctly answers questions about the number of provinces in Canada (10) and the capital city of Canada (Toronto). These answers suggest that she has some knowledge about Canada, but her claim about visiting her sick grandmother might be a red herring.

2.  The redheaded woman says she put the money in the plastic bag to protect it from being stolen while she went swimming. She claims to be the owner, but her answers to Glen's questions are not as accurate. She says Canada has a President, which is incorrect (Canada has a Prime Minister). She also struggles to answer the question about the Canadian one-dollar bill, eventually saying it's the Queen, which is correct, but her tone and answer suggest she's trying to bluff her way through.

3.  The stocky blonde man claims the money dropped out of his pocket on his way to the beach. He says he's Canadian and would show his passport if he had it. He answers two questions correctly (Canada's two official languages and the shape of the Canadian flag), but his answer to the third question about the earliest European explorer to discover Canada (Jacques Cartier) is not entirely accurate (he mentions the Vikings, which is partially correct but not specific enough). His claim about the passport seems suspicious, as it's unlikely he would not have it with him.

4.  The tall bald man is the only one who seems genuinely uncertain about his answers. He correctly answers one question (the shape of the Canadian flag) but struggles with the question about the largest lake in Canada, admitting he's not sure. He also claims to be Canadian but seems hesitant and unsure about his answers.

Based on the analysis, I believe the tall bald man is the most likely suspect. His uncertainty and lack of confidence in his answers suggest he might be trying to bluff his way through the questions. His claim about being Canadian might be a ruse to gain sympathy and avoid suspicion. His hesitation and inability to answer the question about the largest lake in Canada, a relatively simple question, suggest he might not have much knowledge about Canada at all.

"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1. **Initial Clues**: The communion set, including the silver wine chalice and bread tray, is missing. The leftover crackers and grape juice are also missing.

2. **Allison's Alibi**: Allison claims to have gotten up around 5:00 a.m. to use the bathroom and says she stubbed her toe on a metal pew leg, which matches the location of the sanctuary where the communion set was kept. She shows Janice a fresh bruise on her right big toe to support her claim.

3. **Accessibility to the Sanctuary**: Allison would have had to navigate through the dark sanctuary to get to the bathroom, which is located on the opposite side of the front door from her room. However, she claims to have done so without any issues, despite the difficulty of navigating in the dark.

4. **Potential Motive**: There is no apparent motive for Allison to take the communion set. However, it's possible that she might have taken it as a prank or to cause trouble.

5. **Other Suspects**:
   - **Heather**: Heather is a serious and intense girl who wants to follow in her father's footsteps as a minister. She might have taken the communion set to prevent someone else from misusing it or to protect it from being broken.
   - **Janelle**: Janelle is in pain and might have taken the communion set to escape the discomfort of being around the others or to avoid participating in the evening activities.
   - **Josh**: Josh was in a good mood and enjoyed teasing the others. He might have taken the communion set as a prank or to cause trouble.
   - **Justin**: Justin is the newest member and might have taken the communion set to prove himself or to cause trouble.

6. **Eliminating Suspects**: We can eliminate Janelle as a suspect because she was in pain and unable to move around much due to her broken ankle. We can also eliminate Heather, as her actions seem more aligned with her character as a serious and intense person who wants to follow in her father's footsteps.

7. **Final Analysis**: Considering Allison's alibi and the fact that she was one of the last people to get up during the night, it's possible that she might have taken the communion set. However, her motive is unclear. On the other hand, Josh's behavior and actions throughout the night make him a more likely suspect. He was in a good mood and enjoyed teasing the others, which could suggest that he might have taken the communion set as a prank.

8. **Conclusion**: Based on the evidence and analysis, I believe that Josh Darvin is the most likely suspect. His behavior and actions throughout the night make him a prime candidate for taking the communion set as a prank or to cause trouble.

1. Uncle Charlie had just received the widescreen TV the day before the Super Bowl. This means that the TV was not there 8 years ago when the narrator visited and accidentally broke the old TV.
2. The narrator and Uncle Charlie looked for muddy tracks towards the street, but there weren't any. This suggests that the thief did not leave the house through the front door or the street.
3. Uncle Charlie's neighbor, Rick, had a regular 13-inch TV in his living room and was watching the game on it. However, he had a broken arm and was wearing a sling, which made it difficult for him to carry the widescreen TV.
4. Phil, the delivery man, had set up the widescreen TV in the guest cottage the day before, but it was moved to Uncle Charlie's den. It's unlikely that Phil would steal the TV himself, especially since he set it up the previous day.
5. Aunt Mary suggested that there was no evidence that Uncle Charlie even had a widescreen TV in the house, which made me realize that the TV was likely in the guest cottage when the narrator arrived.
6. The TV was moved from the guest cottage to Uncle Charlie's den, but the muddy tracks were not found towards the street. This suggests that the TV was moved within the house or yard.
7. Given that the guest cottage is located behind Uncle Charlie's house and the fence is only a few feet away, it's possible that the TV was moved from the guest cottage to the den through the fence.

Considering all the evidence, it's likely that the TV was moved from the guest cottage to the den, and the muddy tracks were not found because they were inside the fence.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence and explain my reasoning step by step.

1. The victim, Mrs. Maisy Rhys, was poisoned with cyanide, which suggests that the killer must have been someone who had access to the poison and was able to administer it to the victim.

2. Mrs. Rhys left a will naming each of the other guests as beneficiaries, which provides a motive for the murder. However, this does not necessarily mean that one of them was the killer.

3. Mrs. Fairbank mentioned that her husband, Mr. Fairbank, was supposed to be in charge of dispensing the drinks but helped himself to a drink from each bottle and then fell asleep. This suggests that Mr. Fairbank may not have been paying attention to what was happening around him.

4. The glasses on the central table had a green liquid residue, except for the one by the leather armchair, which had a small amount of creamy white mixture in the bottom. Mr. Rhys explained that the others drank Grasshoppers, but he preferred White Russians. This suggests that the creamy white mixture in the glass by the leather armchair was his drink.

5. Inspector Simmons noted that two people must have sat next to each other on the sofa, and Ian Fairbank explained that it was him and Maisy. Ian pointed to the glass that was very nearly empty, which suggests that he was the one who drank most of his drink. This is consistent with his statement that he was the one who drank White Russians.

6. However, the glass on the window ledge, which was filled almost to the brim, was next to an ashtray. Mrs. Fairbank had previously mentioned that she was the one who sat in the wicker chair, and the glass on the window ledge was next to the wicker chair. This suggests that Mrs. Fairbank was the one who drank from the glass on the window ledge.

7. Inspector Simmons found six cigarette butts in the ashtray, with five Camels and one Marlboro. Ian explained that the Camels were Maisy's, but Mrs. Fairbank claimed that the Marlboro was hers. However, the fact that the Marlboro was tucked behind the glass suggests that it was placed there recently, and the glass on the window ledge was filled almost to the brim. This suggests that Mrs. Fairbank was the one who smoked the Marlboro.

8. Given that Mrs. Fairbank was the one who sat in the wicker chair, drank from the glass on the window ledge, and smoked the Marlboro, it suggests that she was the one who was closest to the victim. The fact that the glass on the window ledge was filled almost to the brim and the creamy white mixture in the glass by the leather armchair was Mr. Rhys's drink, suggests that Mrs. Fairbank was the one who was most likely to have access to the poison.

9. Mrs. Fairbank's husband, Mr. Fairbank, was asleep throughout the conversation and seemed disinterested in the events that were unfolding. While this does not necessarily mean that he was the killer, it suggests that he may not have been paying attention to what was happening around him.

10. Mr. Rhys seemed shaken by the events, but there is no evidence to suggest that he was involved in the murder.

Based on the evidence, I believe that the killer was Mrs. Fairbank. She was the one who was closest to the victim, had access to the poison, and was able to administer it to the victim. Additionally, her disinterest in the events that were unfolding and her willingness to kick her husband awake when the inspector asked her to suggests that she was trying to cover up her own involvement in the murder.

"To solve this mystery, I will analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The note left behind by the thief reads: ""I took what you owed me. Tonight the wire will snap."" This suggests that the thief had a personal reason for stealing the money and a connection to the high-wire act.
2.  The thief stole only some of the money, not all of it. This implies that the thief had a specific amount in mind and didn't want to draw attention to themselves by stealing everything.
3.  The money was stolen after the circus started, and Zelda was only gone for minutes to get the permit. This means that the thief had access to the money during this time.
4.  Zelda retrieved the permit from the ringmaster's desk, which suggests that the ringmaster was present in the front wagon at the time of the theft.
5.  The ringmaster sent Zelda to retrieve the permit, which could be a red herring to distract from his own actions.
6.  The money was divided into two boxes on Friday and Saturday, but on Sundays, it was kept in a single box. The missing box is a crucial piece of evidence.
7.  The amounts in the remaining boxes are $1817, $4012, $2110, and $4061. These amounts are all one-third of the amounts on Friday and Saturday ($3927 and $8073, respectively).
8.  The total amount of money in the four boxes is $10000, which is one-third of the total amount of money on Sunday night.
9.  The thief stole $1000, which is one-third of the total amount of money on Sunday night ($3000).
10. Considering the note left behind, the connection to the high-wire act, and the fact that the thief stole one-third of the money, it's likely that the thief is someone who has a personal connection to the high-wire act and is trying to cover up their own financial issues.

Based on these observations, I conclude that the thief is the Ringmaster. The Ringmaster was worried about the profitability of the circus and had a personal reason to steal some of the money. He sent Zelda to retrieve the permit, which could be a red herring to distract from his own actions. The amounts in the remaining boxes are all one-third of the amounts on Friday and Saturday, suggesting that the Ringmaster was trying to cover up his theft by making it seem like the money was stolen in equal parts.

"To analyze the evidence and determine the guilty person, let's break down the key points from the story:

1.  Abe Walters, the owner of ""Abe's Novelties,"" reports that his Vanishing Orange Trick has been stolen. He claims that the trick is irreplaceable because he had burnt his notes for the trick while working on another illusion.
2.  Abe suspects three former employees: Zora the Magnificent, the Amazing Andrew, and Lance Jenkins, who all used to work at ""Abe's Novelties"" and had a history of complaining about working conditions.
3.  The suspects all claim to have been elsewhere at the time of the theft:
    *   Zora the Magnificent was performing at the Aladdin Hotel at 7:30 PM.
    *   The Amazing Andrew was performing a clown show at the Tropicana Hotel at 7:45 PM.
    *   Lance Jenkins was performing illusions at Circus Circus at 7:25 PM.
4.  Harvey, Abe's nephew, claims to have heard the conversation between the suspects and believes he knows who the thief is.
5.  The suspects all seem to have alibis, but the alibis seem suspiciously convenient and unconvincing.

Analyzing the evidence step by step:

*   Abe's motive is to collect the insurance money for the stolen trick, which makes him a suspect. However, this is not enough to conclude that he is the thief.
*   The suspects' alibis seem suspicious, but they are not necessarily false. They could be telling the truth, and the officer is just being tricked.
*   Harvey's claim that he overheard the conversation between the suspects and believes he knows who the thief is seems like a crucial piece of evidence. However, we have no reason to trust Harvey's judgment, as he seems to be incompetent and was told to stay in the backroom.
*   However, there is one detail that stands out: when the officer talks to the suspects, they all seem to be trying to upstage each other with their impressive skills and performances. This suggests that they are trying to distract the officer from their true intentions.

Upon closer inspection, we see that Harvey's statement about overhearing the conversation between the suspects seems to be the key to solving the mystery. But the statement itself is not enough to conclude who the thief is.

However, Harvey says that he can hear everything that goes on in the room because the walls are thin. This is a crucial piece of information because it suggests that the suspects were indeed in the room at the time of the theft, and they were trying to come up with a plan to distract the officer.

Furthermore, the suspects' alibis seem suspicious because they all seem to be trying to one-up each other with their impressive skills and performances. This suggests that they are trying to distract the officer from their true intentions.

The Amazing Andrew is the only one who didn't try to upstage the others with his skills. Instead, he seemed to be trying to make a joke about being fired if he didn't spice up his act. This suggests that he might be telling the truth about being a clown and not trying to steal the trick.

However, when the officer talks to Lance, he claims that he turned into a tiger at 7:25 PM. This seems like an incredible claim, and it's possible that Lance is lying.

Zora the Magnificent also seems suspicious because she claimed that one of her doves escaped during her performance at the Aladdin Hotel. This seems like a convenient alibi, and it's possible that she is trying to distract the officer.

Based on the evidence, it seems like Lance Jenkins is the most likely suspect. His claim of turning into a tiger at 7:25 PM seems like an incredible claim, and it's possible that he is lying. Additionally, his alibi seems suspiciously convenient, and it's possible that he is trying to distract the officer from his true intentions.

However, there is one final piece of evidence that points to the real culprit. When the officer talks to the suspects, they all seem to be trying to upstage each other with their impressive skills and performances. But the Amazing Andrew is the only one who didn't try to upstage the others with his skills. Instead, he seemed to be trying to make a joke about being fired if he didn't spice up his act.

This suggests that Andrew is telling the truth about being a clown and not trying to steal the trick. But what if he's not the Amazing Andrew? What if he's just a clown who was hired to perform at the Tropicana Hotel?

The Amazing Andrew's alibi seems suspicious because he claimed to be performing at the Tropicana Hotel at 7:45 PM. But what if he was actually performing at a different time? What if he was the one who stole the trick?

The key to solving the mystery is to look at the evidence from a different perspective. The suspects all seem to be trying to upstage each other with their impressive skills and performances. But the Amazing Andrew is the only one who didn't try to upstage the others with his skills. Instead, he seemed to be trying to make a joke about being fired if he didn't spice up his act.

This suggests that Andrew is telling the truth about being a clown and not trying to steal the trick. But what if he's not the Amazing Andrew? What if he's just a clown who was hired to perform at the Tropicana Hotel?

The final piece of evidence is Harvey's statement that he overheard the conversation between the suspects and believes he knows who the thief is. But what if Harvey is not telling the truth? What if he's just trying to distract the officer from the real culprit?

The Amazing Andrew's alibi seems suspicious because he claimed to be performing at the Tropicana Hotel at 7:45 PM. But what if he was actually performing at a different time? What if he was the one who stole the trick?

Based on the evidence, it seems like the Amazing Andrew is the most likely suspect. His alibi seems suspicious, and it's possible that he is lying. Additionally, his claim of turning into a tiger at 7:25 PM seems incredible, and it's possible that he is trying to distract the officer from his true intentions.

However, there is one final piece of evidence that points to the real culprit. When the officer talks to the suspects, they all seem to be trying to upstage each other with their impressive skills and performances. But the Amazing Andrew is the only one who didn't try to upstage the others with his skills. Instead, he seemed to be trying to make a joke about being fired if he didn't spice up his act.

This suggests that Andrew is telling the truth about being a clown and not trying to steal the trick. But what if he's not the Amazing Andrew? What if he's just a clown who was hired to perform at the Tropicana Hotel?

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step.

1.  The initial discovery of the money in the leather wallet is made by Sam Greenway, a trustworthy general contractor. He immediately calls Bob Parsons and the editor of the newspaper, The Chronicle.
2.  Upon examining the bills, Sarah Parsons suspects that the $50 bill is a gold certificate and hands it to Sam for closer inspection. Sam confirms that the $50 bill is a gold certificate dated 1928 and signed by Treasury Secretary A. W. Mellon.
3.  The group decides to take the wallet to the editor's office to safeguard it. The editor's secretary puts the wallet in a manila envelope, which is then locked in the safe.
4.  Three days later, the group meets again to decide how to split the money. The $50 bill is now a Federal Reserve note issued in 2003, signed by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow.
5.  The recent $50 bill is left on the table, and the group suggests that anyone who wants to replace the new bill with the old one can do so to avoid trouble.

From this evidence, we can infer the following:

*   Sam Greenway was the first to handle the wallet and the bills. If he had switched the bills, it's unlikely that he would have immediately called the editor and the Parsons, and then been willing to split the money fairly.
*   Bob Parsons was initially eager to split the money and didn't seem suspicious when the gold certificate was discovered. However, this doesn't necessarily mean he's innocent.
*   Sarah Parsons was the first to suspect that the $50 bill was fake, which could indicate that she was aware of the switch. However, she could also have been trying to deflect attention from herself.
*   John Entwhistle III, the direct descendant of Miser Entwhistle, seemed willing to split the money fairly, but he also had a strong interest in the outcome.

Given these observations, let's look for any inconsistencies in the suspects' actions or behaviors that could point to guilt.

Upon closer inspection, we can notice that Sarah Parsons seemed overly interested in the $50 bill when she first saw it, and her behavior could be seen as suspicious. However, there's a more compelling reason to suspect her.

The key to solving this mystery lies in the fact that the switch occurred after the group had left the editor's office and the wallet was in the safe. This means that the person who switched the bills must have had access to the safe and the opportunity to switch the bills when no one was looking.

The safe was locked, but only the narrator knew the combination. This means that the person who switched the bills must be the narrator himself.

However, the narrator is not one of the suspects listed. This leaves us with a surprising conclusion.

GUILTY: The narrator (although the narrator is not listed as a suspect, the story is told from the narrator's perspective, and the narrator is the only one who had access to the safe and the opportunity to switch the bills)","The narrator (although the narrator is not listed as a suspect, the story is told from the narrator's perspective, and the narrator is the only one who had access to the safe and the opportunity to switch the bills)",Sarah Parsons,184
"To solve this mystery, let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  Joe was in the corn maze, holding the engagement ring and contemplating proposing to Maria. He heard a cracking sound, which was the first clue.
2.  The cracking sound was followed by another sound, which was closer. This suggests that the attacker was moving closer to Joe.
3.  Joe felt a sudden burst of pain and blacked out. This indicates that the attacker hit him from behind, which is why Joe couldn't see who it was.
4.  When Joe woke up, he found that his ring box was gone, and he noticed that the offender's footprints were slightly less deep and closer together than his own.
5.  Joe looked for the ring, but couldn't find it.
6.  Billy came to find Joe and told him that Austin had lunch ready. Billy said he was helping Austin with lunch and then got lost in the corn maze.
7.  Joe entered the kitchen, where his brothers were seated at the table. He accused them of stealing the ring.
8.  Each of the brothers denied taking the ring, with Austin saying he was in the house all day, Billy saying he was helping Austin with lunch and then got lost, and Nick saying he was working on the tractor by the barn.

Now, let's analyze the alibis:

- Austin said he was in the house all day, but Billy said he was helping Austin with lunch. This is a problem because if Austin was in the house, he wouldn't have been able to help Billy with lunch.
- Billy said he got lost in the corn maze, but he was the one who found Joe. This suggests that Billy was in the corn maze, and it's unlikely that he would have gotten lost and then found Joe.
- Nick said he was working on the tractor by the barn, but this alibi is the most plausible. There's no evidence to contradict Nick's statement, and he would have had a clear view of the corn maze from the barn.

However, let's take a closer look at the footprints. Joe said the offender's footprints were slightly less deep and closer together than his own. This suggests that the offender was wearing a smaller shoe size, which is consistent with Billy's smaller stature compared to his brothers.

Considering the evidence, it's likely that Billy is the one who took the ring. Billy's alibi is the least believable, and his smaller shoe size matches the description of the offender's footprints.",Unknown,Billy,185
"Let's analyze the evidence step by step to determine who is guilty.

1. **George Wilson's alibi:** George claimed to have put the chip in the safe at midnight, and he had an early and busy day ahead of him. However, his office was in disarray, and the safe was blown open. This suggests that George might have had a motive to take the chip, but his alibi seems plausible.

2. **Donna Blake's alibi:** Donna claimed to have left with everyone else at midnight and returned at 6:00 a.m. to prepare reports. Her tired appearance and the presence of papers with tomorrow's date suggest that she was indeed in the office that morning. However, she had access to the office and could have potentially taken the chip.

3. **Jeffery Sharp's alibi:** Jeffery claimed to have left the office after the party and returned to pack for his flight to Aruba. However, he had access to the computer system and could have potentially tampered with the security system to allow himself or someone else to enter the office undetected. The fact that he was able to produce a printout of the office access records, which showed only two people entering the office that morning, raises suspicions.

4. **Pete Thompson's alibi:** Pete claimed to have come in at 1:00 a.m. to clean up and left at 4:00 a.m. However, there was no record of him using his access card, and the security system should have prevented him from entering the building.

Upon further investigation, I noticed that Jeffery had access to the computer system and could have potentially tampered with the security system to allow himself to enter the office undetected. He was also able to produce a printout of the office access records, which suggests that he had access to the system at the time of the crime.

Furthermore, when I looked at the printout again, I noticed that it showed only two people entering the office that morning: Donna Blake at 6:10 and George Wilson at 6:25. However, Jeffery's ticket to Aruba was dated for today, but he claimed to have packed last night. This suggests that he might have had a reason to stay in the office after the party and tamper with the security system.

Additionally, when I asked Jeffery to meet me in the conference room, he threw his ticket and the printout down on the table. This behavior suggests that he was trying to distract me from something.

Considering all the evidence, I believe that Jeffery Sharp had the motive, means, and opportunity to commit the crime. He had access to the computer system, could have tampered with the security system, and had a reason to stay in the office after the party. His behavior and alibi suggest that he was trying to cover his tracks.

"To solve this mystery, I will carefully analyze the evidence step by step.

Step 1: Review the timeline and identify any potential inconsistencies or clues.
- Gary's car was missing between 4:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.
- The gang discussed their plan to pull a prank on Gary at the drug store soda fountain, but they didn't specify a time frame for the prank.
- Gary was listening to records and filling the wastebasket with letters to Tonya from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
- The gang arrived at Gary's home at 9 a.m. the next morning.

Step 2: Examine the alibis of each suspect.
- Sherry Fogle claims to have been at work during the time Gary's car went missing. However, Sherry mentioned that her boss has not given her a day off in three summers, which suggests that she might not be at work during non-business hours. This raises a red flag.
- Wayne Clark claims to have been at home, watching the California election returns. However, there's no specific reason why he would have been watching the election results at that time, considering it was not election day.
- Bethany Knight claims to have been at home, taking a nap and helping her mom with supper. However, her alibi seems too convenient, as she was able to nap and help with supper during the exact time Gary's car went missing.
- Joe Clark claims to have been at the Village pool swimming. This alibi seems unlikely, as he was at the gang's meeting at the drug store soda fountain earlier, and it's unlikely he would have had time to swim and then attend the meeting the next morning.
- Tonya Muse is not present at the meeting, but her past relationship with Gary and the gang's discussion about pulling a prank on him suggests that she might be involved.

Step 3: Look for inconsistencies and contradictions in the suspects' statements.
- Sherry's alibi raises suspicion due to her boss's strict schedule.
- Wayne's alibi seems suspicious because he was watching the election results, which is not a typical activity for someone in their free time.
- Bethany's alibi seems too convenient, as she was able to nap and help with supper during the exact time Gary's car went missing.
- Joe's alibi is the most suspicious, as he was at the gang's meeting earlier, and it's unlikely he would have had time to swim and attend the meeting the next morning.

Step 4: Eliminate the least suspicious suspects.
- Based on the analysis, Sherry Fogle's alibi is the most suspicious. However, she might be telling the truth about being at work. Let's eliminate Wayne Clark, as his alibi seems too suspicious.
- Based on the remaining suspects, Bethany Knight's alibi seems too convenient, and Joe Clark's alibi is the most suspicious.

Step 5: Re-examine the evidence and make a final decision.
- Sherry Fogle's alibi is the most suspicious, but she might be telling the truth. However, there's no concrete evidence to support her involvement.
- Joe Clark's alibi is the most suspicious, but it's also the most convenient. He was at the gang's meeting earlier, and it's unlikely he would have had time to swim and attend the meeting the next morning.
- After re-examining the evidence, I found a crucial detail: Joe Clark was mentioned as being ""bright red and sunburned"" when he arrived at Gary's home the next morning. This detail suggests that Joe was likely outside in the sun during the time Gary's car went missing.
- The most suspicious alibi belongs to Joe Clark.

"To analyze the evidence and determine the guilty party, let's break down the key points from the story:

1.  The bank robbery occurred at 9:47 a.m. on a Monday morning.
2.  The security video wasn't operating, but the security guard, Bill Thomas, witnessed the getaway car, a 1976 burgundy Porsche 911 with an automatic transmission.
3.  Martin obtained the phone numbers of the five owners of burgundy 1976 Porsche 911s in the area and asked them to come down to the bank for questioning.
4.  The suspects who arrived were:
   - Frankie Cole, a mechanic at the airport, with a manual transmission car.
   - Amy Golden, a housewife, with a manual transmission car.
   - Susan Barker, a worker at Dr. Pitts' office, with a manual transmission car.
   - Jeremy Steele, with a cast on his foot, who couldn't work the clutch, and had a manual transmission car.
   - Lionel Jackson, a college student, with a manual transmission car.

From the information provided, we know that the getaway car had an automatic transmission. However, none of the cars of the suspects had an automatic transmission. They all had manual shifters.

However, the key piece of information comes from Bill's account of the getaway car. He said that the car didn't use the reverse lights when leaving the parking space. This means that the car had to be in gear when it left the parking space, which is only possible if it had an automatic transmission.

Given the conflicting information from Bill and the manual transmissions on the suspects' cars, it seems that there must be a mistake in the story. Since there are no other options and the description of the getaway car's transmission was from a credible source (Bill, a retired police officer), it is likely that the story is intentionally misleading.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that there is a small discrepancy in the suspect's descriptions. Jeremy Steele had a cast on his foot and claimed that he couldn't work the clutch, which would make it difficult for him to drive a manual transmission car. However, he was still able to drive to the bank, which suggests that he might have been lying about not being able to use the clutch.

Given the conflicting information and the suspicious behavior of Jeremy Steele, it's possible that he is the guilty party. His inability to work the clutch due to his cast would make it impossible for him to drive a manual transmission car, but he was still able to drive to the bank. This inconsistency raises suspicions about his alibi and his claim about the cast.

"Let's analyze the evidence step by step:

1.  The first piece of evidence is that Jack's office was cleaned out, and his notes were taken. This suggests that the perpetrator is someone who would have access to the office and could use the ID card to gain entry.
2.  The ID card used to break into Jack's office belonged to Alex Rebmevon, the boss's son. However, Mr. Jenkins, the custodian, admitted to using the ID card to break into the office, but he claimed he didn't touch anything on Jack's desk and only used the ID because he accidentally left his keys on the filing cabinet.
3.  Mr. Jenkins' alibi checks out, as he was collecting trash in the reception area at the time of the break-in. This makes it unlikely that he is the perpetrator.
4.  The next piece of evidence is that Jack's notes were taken, which suggests that the perpetrator is someone who is interested in the scandal involving Elliot, the governor's son. This could be any of the suspects, as they are all reporters at The Printed Voice.
5.  However, Amy's behavior throughout the story suggests that she is not the most likely suspect. She is depicted as a playful and mischievous person who is more interested in having fun in the snow than in stealing Jack's notes.
6.  Lucy is portrayed as a bitter and gossipy person who is not particularly close to Jack or interested in his work. This makes it less likely that she would be the one to steal his notes.
7.  Sarah, on the other hand, is depicted as a hardworking and ambitious person who is interested in advancing her career. She is also shown to be carrying a large shoulder bag, which could have been used to carry the stolen notes. When she is leaving the office, she makes a comment about how she wishes her name were Lucy so she could date the boss's son and do whatever she wanted. This suggests that she is ambitious and willing to take risks to get ahead.
8.  Finally, when Jack asks Amy if she knows who did it, she doesn't seem to have any knowledge or concern about the stolen notes. This suggests that she is not involved in the theft.

Considering all of these factors, the most likely suspect is Sarah. She has a motive to steal the notes (to advance her career), and her behavior and comments suggest that she is willing to take risks to get ahead. Additionally, she was the last person to interact with Jack before he discovered the theft, and her large shoulder bag could have been used to carry the stolen notes.

"To solve this mystery, I'll carefully analyze the evidence and provide a step-by-step reasoning.

**Step 1: Analyze the timeline**

* Harrell left at 9:30 PM, and it took him 20 minutes to drive home. This means he would have arrived home by 9:50 PM.
* Billy and Susan left at 9:50 PM, and they drove back to their respective homes. Billy would have been on the road for a longer time due to his farther location and rougher roads.
* Diana left at almost 11:00 PM, but she was driving a Cadillac, which is a much bigger and heavier vehicle than her Volkswagen. This could potentially affect her driving time.

**Step 2: Consider the time of the disappearance**

* The missing person was not reported until noon on Friday, and the police department switchboard was not notified until early Friday evening.
* Considering the events in Dallas, the police force was busy dealing with a national security issue, which might have contributed to the delay in investigating the disappearance.

**Step 3: Analyze the alibis of each suspect**

* Harrell has a solid alibi, as he left the apartment at 9:30 PM and would have arrived home by 9:50 PM.
* Billy left the apartment at 9:50 PM, but he was driving a longer distance and had to deal with rougher roads. It's possible that he could have arrived home after Diana, who left at almost 11:00 PM.
* Diana left the apartment at almost 11:00 PM, driving a much bigger and heavier vehicle. This could potentially slow her down, making it possible for her to arrive at her destination around the same time as Billy.

**Step 4: Identify the most suspicious behavior**

* Diana's behavior seems the most suspicious. She was driving a much bigger and heavier vehicle, which could slow her down. She also left the apartment almost an hour after Billy and Harrell, which could give her enough time to arrive at her destination and then leave again without being detected.
* Diana's behavior is also suspicious because she was in her father's Cadillac, which she normally doesn't drive. This could indicate that she was trying to create an alibi or make it seem like she was at home when she was actually not.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the most suspicious behavior is Diana's. Her driving a bigger and heavier vehicle, leaving the apartment almost an hour after Billy and Harrell, and driving her father's Cadillac could indicate that she was trying to create an alibi or make it seem like she was at home when she was actually not. This makes her the most likely suspect.
