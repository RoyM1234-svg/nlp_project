"Rubbernecking is a dangerous sport. I should know, because I just about hit a cop on my drive to the racket club. There was a traffic accident on the corner of Main and King, blocking the entrance to the Java Hut. The ornate “Open” sign inside the Java Hut window taunted me -- if I could just get past the yellow barricades, I thought. As I surveyed the wreckage, mourning the loss of my morning coffee, I almost missed the fact that the streetlight had changed from green to red. As I slammed on the breaks, with my car stopping inches from a police officer crossing the road, I knew that I was in big trouble. Fortunately, I got off with just a warning. The police officer came to my window and glared at me. “You should keep your eyes on the road,” he said. “Sorry, officer,” I said. “I’ll be more careful in the future. But if you don’t mind my asking, what happened here?” “Yes, I do mind,” he said, and strode off just before the light turned green. I resisted the urge to sneak another glance at the accident scene, but my curiosity was fulfilled later. Anyway ... when I arrived at the racket club, I felt like calling that police officer to help me out because the club’s patrons had to pay for parking, and as far as I’m concerned, that’s just criminal (especially considering that I know how much my cousin Dave Perkins paid in membership dues). And it wasn’t even a flat fee for parking, they gave you a time-stamped ticket and you had to pay for every quarter hour segment of your stay on your way out. It didn’t seem to bother my cousin, though. When I entered the club’s lobby, Dave was waiting for me on a leather couch drinking a cup of Java Hut coffee. He looked relaxed. “Don’t get too comfortable,” I said. I pointed at the clock -- it was 9:50 a.m. “Our court time is in ten minutes. And that means you’ll be losing in exactly eleven minutes ...” “Are you sure you’re up for this?” Dave asked. “You haven’t played squash in years.” “I beat you when we were teenagers, and I’ll beat you now,” I said. “Loser buys lunch,” he said. Good thing I brought my credit card. I lost -- badly -- and I had a sinking suspicion that Dave would order the club’s most expensive bottle of wine. But first we decided to hit the steam room. My aching muscles needed it. Dave’s co-workers from the Water Works plumbing company, Larry Douglas and Chris Henderson, were already in the steam room when we arrived after our half-hour session on the squash court. “I squashed Larry,” Chris gloated after Dave introduced me. “Did you take care of Dave?” “Well,” I said, embarrassed. “I, uh--” “He was off his game because he didn’t have his morning coffee,” Dave said, coming to my rescue. “Java Hut was—“ “Big deal,” Chris said, “Java Hut was closed when I drove by, too. I beat Larry with un-caffeinated skill.” “That’s because I was half asleep from waiting for you so long on that comfy couch out front,” Larry said. “I wondered why you were still in here,” Dave said. “I thought you had a 9:30 court time.” “We did, but we didn’t end up starting until 9:45. Good thing you guys booked a different court number. There was nobody on ours after us, so we played until nearly 10:30. Besides, he only beat me by--” “Never mind your scores,” said Nathan Elliot as he entered the steam room. “We’ve got more important things to talk about.” Water Works’ owner stood at the door with his arms crossed. Unlike the rest of us, he wasn’t dressed in just a large towel; he wore a three-piece suit. He looked very uncomfortable as the steam caused him to sweat instantly. But it was my turn to feel uncomfortable when he turned his focus on me. His eyes narrowed. “Who are you?” he demanded. “I’m Dave’s cousin, Rick,” I said, trying my best to sound friendly in deference to not causing Dave any problems. “I believe I took your place on the squash court today.” “That’s right,” Nathan said. “I wasn’t supposed to be here” He looked down at his suit, “Obviously. I left my niece’s wedding to fire one of you!” All three of his employees sat bolt upright, suddenly on edge. I, too, felt the stress of the situation, despite not being at any personal risk. Then again, I was at risk of passing out from too much steam. Nathan, who for all intents and purposes was blocking the exit, said, “I’m not moving until I find out who caused that accident at Main and King.” “What makes you think it was one of us?” Chris asked. “Witnesses all described our Water Works vans. No one caught the license plate, but it had to be one of you three.” “Or you,” I said. I was no longer worried about being friendly. If he was the culprit and he was trying to frame my cousin, then Dave would have a lot more to worry about than losing his job. And I have to admit, that if Dave was guilty, the thought of providing an alibi for him did cross my mind. But only momentarily. Do the crime, do the time, I always say. “I didn’t drive my van to the wedding -- while I normally love getting the company logo in front of as many eyeballs as possible, my wife would never step foot in that van in an expensive gown,” Nathan said. “What time did the accident happen?” Larry asked. “Around 9:35.” “I got here at 8:30,” Larry said, “I have a ticket on my dash.” “Did anyone see you?” Nathan asked. “Well, no, but ... why don’t you just go look at our vans,” Larry said. “Mine’s in the parking lot and it’ll be obvious from looking at it that it hasn’t been in any accidents.” “I didn’t say any of you idiots were in an accident,” Nathan said, losing his temper as his suit clung tighter to his sweat-soaked body. “One of you ran a red light. A car that had the right of way swerved to avoid you and smashed into another car. Nobody died, thank God, but I’m sure the police are going to want to talk to whichever one of you walks out of here unemployed ...” “Go ahead and call the police, I said. “I know who caused the accident.”","['Chris Henderson', 'Dave Perkins', 'Larry Douglas', 'Nathan Elliott']",Chris Henderson,Chris Henderson,"Analysis:
The story presents a compelling case against Chris Henderson, driven by a clear motive – a desire to avoid unemployment and a potential attempt to frame his colleagues. The inconsistencies in his alibi, the lack of witnesses confirming his presence at the scene, and his evasive behavior regarding the accident’s timing all point towards his involvement. His aggressive reaction to Nathan Elliott’s accusations, coupled with his dismissive attitude towards the police and the potential for a red light scenario, creates a strong circumstantial case. Furthermore, his recent financial difficulties, as hinted at by his comment about his wife’s wedding, suggest a possible desire to create a false narrative.

Reasoning: Chris’s inconsistent story, his dismissive attitude towards the police, and the potential for a red light scenario all strongly suggest his involvement. His eagerness to deflect blame and his perceived lack of remorse for the accident are red flags. The fact that he was driving a vehicle with a ticket, and his seemingly nonchalant reaction to the police’s questions, further solidify his guilt.

GUILTY: Chris Henderson"
"I was helping to clean up after the school play, “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart.” Mrs. Tillman wrote the play herself and this was the seventh year in a row that the sixth grade had put it on. Tonight's show got a standing ovation and everyone was in a good mood. ""Did you see all those people clapping?"" Eric said, as he swept up the straw that was scattered over the stage. ""I love it! I'm going to be an actor when I grow uh...uh...ah CHOO!"" ""What's wrong, Eric?"" Jenny Jackson asked. ""Is your straw allergy acting up?"" It was true. The lead actor in “How the Scarecrow Got His Heart” was allergic to straw. He broke out in a horrible, itchy rash after the first rehearsal and we had to stuff his costume with paper strips instead of straw. ""No,"" Eric said. ""I only get an allergic reaction when I touch straw."" ""He's just allergic to work,"" said Jimmy. He was Jenny's twin brother. ""Give him a break,"" Wendy LaRue said as she struggled to move one of the big scarecrow props. ""Learning all the lines isn't exactly easy, either."" ""I guess not,"" Jimmy said. ""It's good of you to help, Eric. I would've gone to the party with the rest of the cast if I was you."" ""I guess I just want to spend a little more time here on stage,"" Eric said. ""Being part of the play was so much fun. I'm going to miss it."" ""I'll miss it, too,"" Wendy said. ""But right now, I've got to go. I'm supposed to be at dinner with my parents in twenty minutes."" We all told her to go and wished her a good time. Even with just four of us, it took almost another hour to finish storing away all the backdrops. The real work was dragging the two man-sized, straw-stuffed scarecrows out to the dumpsters. After that was done, the other three students headed home and I stayed to sweep up the stage one last time. I was about to go myself when I noticed that the big smile had disappeared from our teacher's face. ""What's wrong, Mrs. Tillman?"" I asked. ""I can't seem to find the scarecrow's heart,"" she said. She was talking about the central prop for the play. It was a cardboard heart about as big as my chest, all covered with gold foil and plastic beads. ""That's too bad,"" I said. ""But you can always make a new one, right?"" ""Yes,"" Mrs. Tillman replied. ""But this one was very special to me. I made it for the very first production and I've used it every year since. It has a lot of memories attached."" ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Tillman,"" I said. ""Is anything else missing?"" ""No,"" she said. ""Just the heart."" ""Well, I really am sorry it's lost,"" I said. ""It's not your fault,"" Mrs. Tillman assured me. ""You didn't take it."" Those words got me thinking. That night in bed, my mind kept replaying that evening over and over. It was so unlikely that only one prop, which was awfully big and hard to miss, would go missing. Someone must have stolen it. But why, and how? It would have been quite a trick to sneak that thing out of the room without anyone noticing. Before I finally fell asleep, I promised myself that I would get to the bottom of the mystery the very next day. The next day was unusually warm. I wore a pair of shorts and a T-shirt to school for the first time all spring. The nice weather put me in a good mood and I was optimistic about solving the mystery of the scarecrow's heart. I caught up with the twins just before the first bell. I didn't have time to beat around the bush. ""I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,"" I said. ""Do you really think so?"" Jenny asked. ""I do,"" I said. ""Mrs. Tillman said that the heart was the only thing that was missing. It was too big and shiny to get lost."" ""Shiny?"" Jimmy asked. ""That prop was ugly."" ""Yeah,"" Jenny added. ""Why would anyone want to steal that gaudy thing?"" The bell rang and we all had to hurry to our first class. As I made my way through the halls, I thought about what the twins said. Why would anyone steal that heart? I didn't see Eric until lunchtime. He was sitting alone at a table in the corner and was already done with his food before I joined him. ""You must be cold-blooded,"" I said as I sat down. ""Why do you say that?"" he asked. ""Because you're about the only kid I've seen today wearing a long-sleeved shirt."" Eric looked down at his shirt and nodded. ""I've been hearing that all day,"" he said. I leaned in close to him and whispered because I didn't want the whole cafeteria to hear me. ""I think someone stole the scarecrow's heart,"" I said. Eric's eyes grew wide and he whispered back, ""Do you really think so?"" I wondered how many people were going to ask me that. I went through the same explanation I gave the twins. ""I see what you mean,"" Eric said. ""Do you think she's really upset about it?"" ""Sure,"" I said. ""She was really proud of how that heart has been part of the play all seven years that she's done it."" ""Well, maybe it will turn up after all,"" Eric said. Then he scratched his arm and stood up, saying, ""I've got some homework and stuff that I need to get done. I'll see you later."" I said, ""Sure thing,"" and he headed off to empty his tray. Eric prided himself on getting all of his homework done at school. I don't think he ever took any of it home. Wendy sat down just then. ""Where is Eric going?"" she asked. ""To do homework,"" I answered. ""That figures."" Wendy started eating. Just like with the twins and Eric, I came right out and said that I thought someone had stolen the heart. Her eyes flicked up from her burrito and she asked, ""Do you really think so?"" I should have known she'd ask that. I held in a groan and said that I did think so and explained why. She put her fork down and looked me straight in the eye. ""Do you think I stole it?"" she asked. ""I hope not,"" I said. ""Well, I didn't."" Her eyes dropped back down to her food and she picked up her fork again. ""Do you think someone else might have done it?"" I asked. ""Maybe you,"" she said, without looking up. I decided that she was too angry to be of much help. We finished our meals in silence. As soon as I was done, I emptied my tray in the trash and looked for the twins. I found them in the library. ""Hi guys,"" I said. ""Hi,"" they both answered at once. ""How's it going?"" Jenny asked. ""Did you figure out who stole the heart?"" Jimmy said. ""Not yet,"" I said, ""but I think I'm close. I just have one more question for you two."" ""Okay,"" Jimmy said, and Jenny added, ""Shoot."" ""When was the last time you saw the heart?"" ""I saw it when we were cleaning up all the other props,"" Jimmy said. Jenny thought for a moment and added, ""It was probably about fifteen minutes before we left."" I nodded and said, ""Thanks. That was just what I wanted to hear."" I knew who did it and there were still five more minutes left in lunch period.","['Eric Winter', 'Jenny Jackson', 'Jimmy Jackson', 'Wendy LaRue']",Eric Winter,Eric Winter,"Analysis:
The story presents a compelling case against Eric Winter, primarily due to his seemingly nonchalant demeanor and the lack of any discernible motive for stealing a valuable prop. His initial denial, followed by a sudden, seemingly unprompted assertion of knowledge, is highly suspicious. The fact that he was the only one to notice the missing heart, and that he readily offered an explanation that seemed to fit his personality, points to a possible deception. His casual dismissal of the twins’ concerns and Wendy’s questioning, combined with his lack of any genuine concern about the missing prop, creates a sense of calculated avoidance. The fact that he was the only one to notice the missing prop, coupled with his quick dismissal of the twins’ concerns, suggests he was involved in the theft.

Reasoning:
*   **Eric's Denial:** His initial denial of touching straw and his subsequent assertion that the heart was ""too bad"" feels rehearsed and lacks genuine emotion. The sudden shift in his demeanor is unusual for a person who is typically so calm and collected.
*   **Lack of Motive:** Eric’s lack of apparent motivation – why would he steal a prop? – is a significant red flag. He seems more interested in maintaining a facade of normalcy than uncovering the truth.
*   **Contradictory Statements:** His initial denial of touching straw, followed by a statement about how he was “about the only kid wearing a long-sleeved shirt,” creates a jarring contradiction.
*   **Quick Response:** His rapid and seemingly effortless explanation, offering a seemingly plausible narrative, suggests he was trying to deflect suspicion rather than actively investigate.

"The Westbrook High School gymnasium was decorated in WHS colors, green and gold. Volunteers spent most of the day hanging decorations and bringing in tables and chairs, while a kitchen crew prepared turkeys that would be served to hundreds of baseball fans at the upcoming dinner presentation. The rain that started in the late afternoon turned the parking lot into a mud bowl. But that didn’t dampen our spirits – not by a long shot. It was the first time in fifteen years that a Westbrook High School varsity team had won a state championship, a real thrill for one of the smallest schools in the state’s A League. That ranking was a remnant of the days when Westbrook itself had a much larger population. Over the years had come hard times, a factory closing, and families moving away to the further suburbs. But Westbrook High School had held on, with stubborn pride, to its A League ranking, competing against much larger high schools. Well, come to think of it, what other school in the state had received a personal visit from Derek Jeter, star shortstop of the New York Yankees? As generous with his time as he was gifted in the field, Jeter had hosted a baseball clinic at WHS last spring, as the baseball season began. Before he left, Jeter personally signed and dated a brand new second base bag, which was put in a locked display case to inspire the team. That spring, the Westbrook Black Sox – out of nowhere – had a winning season. Correct that – they had a spectacular season! They led the A League for the very first time. Coach Morgan claimed it wasn’t any of his doing. The Derek Jeter magic must have rubbed off on the team. And now, at tonight’s banquet, the high school sports commissioner would visit Westbrook for the first time. Students made jokes about it, “… Bet he needs a map to find us!” There were even rumors that Derek Jeter himself, who we all believed had kept tabs on our baseball team throughout the season, might come. But all of the excitement would end when Principal Carol Jackson came to me in distress. “Sam,” she said, “there’s been a robbery. I just can’t believe it. The display case! Mary Thornton just told me that our prize base is missing!” Why she was calling this to my attention, I can’t say. (Maybe it’s because I’m the very smart editor of our school newspaper, the Tribune?) Anyway, I followed where her bony finger was pointing, straight at the display case. The door was closed, and there was empty space where the autographed second base used to be. I felt sick. “Find out what’s going on, will you? People will be arriving in less than an hour.” I saw Coach Joe Morgan in his nearby office, his door wide open as usual, students going in and out. I gave him the news, adding that the principal told me to find out what had happened. “Glad you’re interested in sports, Sam. We could have used some support during our baseball season. The Tribune didn’t pay us much attention. Not that we needed it!” “Yes, sir.” I could see that he wasn’t going to be of much help. I remembered from Law and Order reruns that people often sounded like wise guys when they were facing an investigation. I’d find out what happened, and that would make a nice addition to my resumé when it came time to apply for admission to college next year. Sam Waters on the case! What would a Law and Order detective want to know? Of course … “Mr. Morgan, who had access to the display case during the cleanup this afternoon?” He thought for a minute, “There are just two sets of keys to the display cases. I have one set, and the principal keeps the other set. I gave my keys to Randy Newsom. He had some help cleaning the case this afternoon. Shorty Gilstrap was with him.” That made sense. Randy Newsom was the baseball team’s all-star captain, and Shorty, appropriately, played shortstop. They were an inseparable combination, on and off the field. I spoke with Randy first. “Sure, Coach Martin asked me and Shorty to clean the case.” “And ...” “We took everything out, the dusted the case. I thought it looked better, but it was just getting dirtier. Plus, Shorty had just come from Art 101, and I was worried that he would get paint on the windows, or on the trophies. … Not that we have many trophies.” “What happened then?” “Well, fortunately, Mary Thornton came by, proudly wearing her cheerleading uniform. She sure does look great in that uniform. It fits her perfectly …” “Randy. Focus! What happened with the display case?” “Oh, right. Well, Mary knew about cleaning stuff. She even had some Windex. We took everything out of the display case once again, and she sprayed the glass windows. Then she wiped them dry. ‘Put them back where you want them,’ she said. I did, and then she left. I had to run, so I gave the keys to Shorty.” “When did you notice that the second base was missing, Randy?” “I didn’t … it’s missing?” “So you put back everything in its place?” “Yes. I did. By the way, I was there most of the time. I only went to grab some Cokes. Then I had to go pick up my date for the banquet.” “Thanks, Randy. That helps a lot.” I sounded more confident than I actually felt. (Well, that’s how they sounded on Law and Order.) Next on my list of suspects: Shorty Gilstrap. “What’s up, dude?” he said. “I hear you were helping Randy clean the display case.” “For a minute or so. But I couldn’t stay long. I had to help bring in tables.” “Wait a second. Was the second base there when you left to see Coach Morgan?” “Absolutely, cross my heart -- and oh, yes, I returned the keys to Coach Morgan.” Next, I spotted Mary Thornton walking toward her locker, decked out in her cheerleading uniform, her sweater dangling below her waist, looking two sizes too big. “Hi Mary. Got a minute?” “Sure. What’s going on? Looking for a scoop for the Tribune?” “Something like that. Randy told me you were a big help in cleaning that display case.” “Somebody had to. Those two were totally hopeless. It seemed to be getting even dirtier, if you can imagine such a thing. Shorty’s nickname should be Pigpen!” “So everything was there when you left?” “I’m quite sure that everything was still there. Later, I did go back and take a second look. One of the trophies was just a bit off center. That annoyed me. I’d been working all day. Even had to take off my sweater, to keep it clean for the banquet. I got some keys from the principal, opened the door, moved the trophy, and then locked the case and returned the keys to her.” “Thanks, Mary. Now I know what happened to our famous souvenir.”","['Coach Joe Morgan', 'Mary Thornton', 'Randy Newsom', 'Shorty Gilstrap']",Mary Thornton,Shorty Gilstrap,"Okay, here’s my analysis, reasoning, and verdict based on the provided story:

**Analysis:**

The core of the mystery revolves around the disappearance of the second base bag, a significant prize for Westbrook High’s baseball team. The fact that the display case was left open, with the bag missing, strongly suggests an attempt to conceal the theft. The presence of Randy Newsom, a key figure in the cleaning process, and Shorty Gilstrap, who was also involved, points to a collaborative effort. The fact that Mary Thornton, seemingly oblivious to the situation, was present at the banquet, and her presence near the display case, is a crucial detail.  The details about the trophy being slightly off-center, and her reaction to it, reveal a moment of frustration and possibly a desire to cover up the incident. The “Dirtier” comment about the display case further suggests a hurried and potentially disorganized effort to clean up after the theft. The fact that she was wearing cheerleading uniform, and seemingly enjoying herself, is a strange detail.

**Reasoning:**

*   **Randy Newsom:** His involvement as the primary cleaner and his knowledge of the display case’s locking mechanism makes him the most logical suspect. The fact that he was the one to leave the keys is significant.
*   **Mary Thornton:** Her presence at the banquet, combined with her seemingly nonchalant demeanor and the fact that she was cleaning the display case, creates a discrepancy. She’s a witness, but her lack of concern and the placement of her belongings near the scene are suspicious. Her comment about the trophy being ""just a bit off center"" could be a deliberate attempt to downplay the situation.
*   **Shorty Gilstrap:** His connection to the display case and his involvement in cleaning suggest he might have been involved in the theft or at least had access to it. The fact that he was the one to return the keys to Mary Thornton is a key piece of evidence.
*   **Coach Joe Morgan:** While he’s a potential suspect, his lack of involvement in the cleaning process and his preoccupied state during the investigation make him a less likely culprit.  His presence at the banquet, and his casual conversation with the students, suggest he was more focused on the event than uncovering the truth.

"Todd Jensen recently inherited the old Jensen family home. He and his wife, Anne, were busy with repairs and remodeling. It was a wonderful inheritance, as the home, built in 1910, was surprisingly modern in design. So, it was on a bitterly cold and dark winter day that Todd sat across from his beloved cousin, Charlene, who had come for a visit. Todd took his seat after pouring steaming mugs of hot chocolate. He began to relate the story he had promised her. He did not tell her there would be a challenge as well … Todd took his first sip of hot chocolate and said, “Thanks for coming. There are some things you need to know.” Todd and Charlene were more than cousins. They had been best friends and confidants for over 30 years – since they were both toddlers in diapers. Charlene replied, “No problem, Todd. What’s on your mind?” Todd took a deep breath. “Well, Anne and I found an old letter. It was pasted on the wall behind the wallpaper in the formal dining room. It was signed my Mildrid Jensen and dated May 25, 1925. She claims her husband Earl was murdered by their son, Edward Jensen. Charlene exclaimed, almost choking on a sip of hot chocolate, “That’s our great-uncle!” “Yeah, I know, replied Todd, dryly, “and she said Edward was murdered in one of the upstairs rooms. Thoughtfully, Charlene answered, “There are four bedrooms, plus a bath upstairs. Which room was it?” Pausing for a moment, she asked, “Are you going to tell the police? What about the rest of the family?” Slowly, Todd answered, “This happened almost 84 years ago. Everyone in that generation is long passed. I believe it would be best to let sleeping dogs lie.” Charlene understood perfectly. She nodded her head and asked, “Why tell me?” “You know that I share everything with you. Besides,” he grinned, “I have a challenge for you.” “What would that be? asked his cousin. “I will tell you the rest of the story, and you tell me what room great-grandfather was murdered in.” He and Charlene played mystery games as children, and now they had an opportunity to analyze a real Jensen family murder mystery. Charlene nodded and told him to continue. Todd began relating his tale. “According to great-grandmother’s letter, Edward killed Earl in a fit of rage. It was about 10:00 p.m. on a spring evening. He was found slumped over in a chair with a knife mark in his neck.” “Why did he kill his own father?” “Mildrid indicated that Edward was what they called in those days, a ‘no-account.’ He was a cocksure 20-year-old who spent too much money and had a violent temper. The letter also says he had gotten a young woman pregnant out of wedlock. That was a serious taboo back then – so serious that it could, and often did, ruin an entire family’s reputation. Anyway, Earl and Edward argued about it. The disagreement was so severe that Earl lost his life because of it.” “May I see the letter?” “After you solve the mystery,” Todd grinned. Both sipped hot chocolate, which was now cool enough to drink. Charlene returned her cousin’s smile and said, “OK. Great-grandfather was murdered. It was covered up and nobody except Mildrid knew of it until you and Anne found the letter while remodeling the dining room?” “As far as we know, that is correct.” “Was he murdered in the same room where he was found?” “Yes.” “All right, what about the other family members? “Mildrid wrote that Anita was terrified and locked herself into her room when the argument began.” “Where was Mildrid?” Todd was pleased that his cousin was warming to her task. “She was downstairs and very frightened, but close to the stairs.” Charlene said, “Tell me about the upstairs bath.” “One of the nicest of its day,” said Todd. “As you know, it was large and even contained a small chair and reading table. It had state of the art plumbing and was one of the first to have a showerhead. The mint colored tile and enamel was very rare then as well.” “Harry … Edward … where were they?” “Harry was not in the house that night. He was estranged from the family in the 1920s. I know this because Dad and Mom used to speak of it. One night, he had a moving truck come and take everything from his room. Harry’s room was empty for a number of years. As far as Edward goes, he was home that night. Mildred did not say where he was when the murder took place.” Todd refilled both cups with fresh chocolate. Charlene considered what she had heard for several minutes while Todd awaited her next question. Finally, she said, “A violent stabbing would have generated a lot of blood. Did any of the upstairs rooms have carpeting?” “Yes,” answered Todd. Edward and Anita’s rooms had carpet. In fact, new carpet had been installed in those rooms shortly before the killing. Mildred and Earl, as Ann and I are now, were doing some remodeling. The house was 15 years old in 1925 and was due for a bit of a facelift. Remember when we were kids? As late as 1983, the original carpets were still in both Edward and Anita’s rooms. They were over 55 years old.” “What about the master bedroom?” “The master bedroom was, for a prominent family such as ours was back then, fairly Spartan. Within the master bedroom there were twin beds, an armoire, a chest of drawers and a small vanity and stool for great-grandmother. No carpeting and, if I recall, they never even had throw rugs to keep their feet warm in the wintertime.” Charlene and Todd sat silent for what seemed a long time. Both finished a second cup of hot chocolate. Finally, Todd asked, “In which room was great-grandfather murdered.”","['Bathroom', 'Bedroom of daughter, Anita Jensen', 'Bedroom of oldest son, Harry Jensen', 'Bedroom of youngest son, Edward Jensen', 'Master bedroom of Earl and Mildrid Jensen']",Bathroom,Harry Jensen,"Analysis:
The evidence strongly points to Harry Jensen as the primary suspect. The fact that Harry was estranged from the family, his room was empty for years, and the new carpeting in his room shortly before the murder, coupled with the lack of carpeting in the master bedroom, paints a clear picture of a premeditated act. The argument about money and a potential pregnancy, as detailed in the letter, suggests a motive for violence. Furthermore, the fact that the murder occurred in the same room as the deceased, despite the lack of carpeting, indicates a deliberate attempt to conceal the crime. The presence of the armoire and chest of drawers in the master bedroom, along with the lack of carpeting, reinforces the idea that the murder was a deliberate attempt to conceal evidence.

Reasoning:
Harry’s history of estrangement and the unexplained absence of his room after the murder are significant. The new carpeting in his room, specifically coinciding with the murder, is a crucial piece of evidence. The fact that he was the last to be seen in the house, and that the carpet was installed shortly before, suggests a deliberate attempt to stage the scene. The argument regarding money and the potential pregnancy further strengthens the theory of a premeditated crime motivated by greed or a desire to cover up a secret. The fact that he was the only one who could have easily accessed the master bedroom, and the lack of carpeting in the room, is a key indicator of his involvement.

"It was almost magic. All the chess pieces looked like little people. My father had owned this set for over 20 years. All our lives, my father had fascinated my siblings and me as he moved the special pieces around the board. In a cabin in the woods, he stored the chess set safely for our family vacation each summer. Every year he'd play one game of chess against our uncle. And each year, the game always ended with Uncle Larry saying the same words. ""Check mate."" But this year would be surprisingly different, since there would be an interrupted game of chess -- and a mystery. After years of watching, my older brother Greg had decided to learn how to play chess. He'd carefully learned to move the pieces and then read several books about the winning strategies for chess. My sister and I didn't even know the names of the pieces, but Greg had practiced continuously against his friends until he was the best player in his school. This year when Uncle Larry arrived for the chess match, we'd finally see if he could beat a new challenger. ""I hope Uncle Larry wins,"" said my younger sister Tina. ""I like Uncle Larry!"" Tina wasn't always a little angel -- but my father admitted that he was thinking about Uncle Larry, too. ""He's always been proud of his chess-playing abilities -- though lately, I wonder if he's as sharp as he used to be. Sometimes he forgets things or repeats the same stories, and when he sends us a letter, the handwriting is really wobbly. It's okay if you beat him, but if you do -- remember to be a good sport!"" But this afternoon, Greg seemed fearless. ""I always win!"" he shouted boastfully. ""Uncle Larry will just have to get used to losing!"" And as if on cue, we heard Uncle Larry pulling up in his car. The cabin was eight miles from the nearest town, so it was lucky we still had our father's chess set. Uncle Larry still remembered how to drive to the cabin, and he was happy to see us waiting for him. Greg wanted to start the game of chess as soon Larry arrived, but my mother and father had prepared a special dinner for the family. ""Why don't you play the game of chess tomorrow night?"" my father suggested. And that's how the mystery began. We'd talked and laughed after dinner, and Greg even set up the chess board in the living room, in anticipation of the big game that would happen the next day. My father carried in a big stack of logs to build a cozy fire, even though he had a back injury and wasn't supposed to lift anything more than 50 pounds. Getting ready for bed that night, I looked to see if my brother was worried. I tossed my sock at him, and said ""Do you really think you can beat Uncle Larry?"" He laughed as he pulled a pebble out of his shoe, and then threw it playfully across the room at me. ""You'll see!"" he said defensively. ""You just wait until tomorrow."" ""I hope he beats you,"" Tina teased. ""You'll all see,"" Greg said confidently. But the next morning -- all the chess pieces were gone. We couldn't play chess without the chess pieces, and we were too far away from the nearest town to get another set. To make things even more frustrating, the thief had left behind a taunting note! In neatly printed letters it said, ""No chess game tonight"" and instead of the word ""night,"" the note had teasingly included a drawing of a knight -- the chess piece that looks like a horse. We thought Uncle Larry had hidden the pieces as a joke -- but we couldn't be sure, and Uncle Larry said playfully that he was ""pretty sure"" that he hadn't. Greg was furious. ""I waited all year for this game!"" Greg wailed melodramatically -- and he stormed outside to sulk in the woods. Our whole family felt bad, and the fun game of chess had turned into a real problem. ""I'm going to try to solve this mystery!"" I confided to my sister Tina. ""Maybe dad's playing a joke on us,"" she suggested. ""Maybe he didn't want to see Greg finally beat Uncle Larry after all of these years."" ""Or maybe Uncle Larry hid them himself,"" I suggested. ""Though I hope that's not true."" We began walking around the cabin, looking for clues. There was no sign of the missing chess set. And then Tina suggested that we look in the woods. There was nothing but trees and the sound of birds chirping. Then suddenly, Tina grabbed my arm and pointed towards the ground by a tree. ""Look!"" she said. I didn't see anything at first -- just the hiking trail, some shrubby bushes, and the tree roots. But then I noticed something white and shiny. It was a chess piece -- a white knight! And it was lying on its side in a pile of pine needles. ""That's ONE piece,"" Tina said optimistically. ""Now we just need to find the rest."" We searched for clues around the tree but found disappointingly few. The hiking trail was too firm to pick up footprints, and the dirt around the tree was filled with little rocks. I studied the bark of the tree, while Tina ran up ahead on the trail. But I noticed something up in the tree that didn't look right. It wasn't wood -- it was a black plastic garbage bag. It was at least 20 feet above the trail, wedged against the tree's trunk where it was joined by a thick branch. There was a hole in the bottom where another white chess piece was poking through. As we stared curiously, a strange thing happened. The white king fell to the trail. Then as a breeze blew threw the braches, the bag came tumbling down. It spilled a pile of chess pieces across the trail, a messy jumble of curvy little pawns and mysterious bishops. ""The chess pieces!"" Tina squealed. We scooped up all the pieces, and ran back into the house. My father laughed and said ""Nice work!"" and Uncle Larry asked, ""Where were they?” Greg was still sulking mood, and seemed disappointed that he hadn't found the pieces himself. Tina glowed with pride, so happy that she'd saved the day. For a minute I wondered if she'd hidden the pieces herself -- just so she could be the one to find them! As the laughter died down, there was a strange silence over our family. ""Shall we set up the chess game?"" my father finally asked. ""After all this excitement, it'll be the best game ever."" ""Maybe we shouldn't,"" I said with concern. ""There's obviously someone in this family who wants to stop this game from being played -- and they want that badly enough to steal all of our chess pieces."" ""Maybe this can be the game that never was,"" my mother suggested gently. My parents weren't sure what to do. To help them out, I decided to make a dramatic announcement. I said ""I know who stole the chess pieces.""","['Father', 'Greg', 'Tina', 'Uncle Larry']",Greg,Uncle Larry,"Analysis:
The story presents a compelling case of a meticulously planned theft and a deliberate attempt to sabotage the chess game. The sudden disappearance of the chess pieces, coupled with the taunting note and the presence of the white knight and garbage bag, strongly suggests foul play. The fact that Uncle Larry was genuinely excited about the game, despite his forgetfulness and the unsettling note, points towards a calculated deception. Greg’s apparent fury and the subsequent storm are indicative of his involvement, driven by a desire to prove his superiority. Tina’s optimism and the discovery of the pieces suggest a possible deception, though her motive remains unclear. The father’s playful demeanor and the eventual announcement of the suspect adds a layer of complexity, hinting at a long-held resentment.

Reasoning:
*   **Father:** His preoccupation with Larry’s chess skills, coupled with his forgetfulness and the note, creates a strong motive for theft. The fact he was happy to play the game despite the missing pieces points towards a desire to maintain a sense of control and perhaps a hidden rivalry.
*   **Greg:** His obsessive desire to win and his apparent fury are key indicators. His boastful behavior and the deliberate attempt to sabotage the game suggest a desire to prove his dominance. His emotional reaction to the theft further reinforces this suspicion.
*   **Tina:** Her optimism and the discovery of the pieces suggest a possible role in the theft, potentially as a means to manipulate the situation or to conceal her own involvement. Her playful tone could be a deliberate attempt to mislead.
*   **Uncle Larry:** His playful demeanor and the seemingly innocent explanation of the note, combined with his apparent enjoyment of the game, create a compelling motive. The garbage bag and the white knight could be a deliberate misdirection.

"Who would have thought that this intolerable job would give me the chance to show my skills as a detective? Not me! The paper is sending someone over to interview me shortly, so I’ve got just enough time to tell you what happened. I’m Sam Jaspers, and I work the night shift, cleaning up and washing the dishes here at the Palace Diner. Some Palace! The counters are so old that the yellow stains are permanent. The regulars would miss them if they ever got scrubbed away, my boss said. Oh yes, the boss (and chef) is Tom Greene. He has owned the place for years. Some say he won it in a crap game. If you ask me, I bet he lost the crap game, and had to take it over! But, as I was saying, I clean the place during the night shift, from 11:00 p.m. to six o’clock in the morning. There’s nobody here after 2:00 a.m., except the occasional trucker, or student pulling an all-nighter to study for exams. My work is really done by around 3:00 a.m., so I get to put in a couple of hours studying, too. I catch up on sleep in the afternoon, after classes. I’m at the university on the top of the hill. But my “scholarship” comes from working at the Palace Diner! Anyway, last night Tom Greene left early. There was just one regular, Mary Ingram, in the restaurant then, around midnight I’d say. The waitress on duty was Louisa Perry. Typically, after Tom leaves, she does whatever short order cooking is necessary, from a grill behind the counter. Well, last night a college student I know, John Beddington, came in to have a cup of coffee, and to fill me in on an assignment that I had missed. I was there in class, but slept through the lecture! Let’s see, the only other person there wasn’t a regular, but she struck up a talk with Mary, and then shared her table. She said her name was Sarah Upton. At one o’clock things had calmed down considerably, so I decided to clean the rest rooms, the one chore I really hate. But it’s a matter of pride to do it right. I did the men’s room first. Then, as usual, I checked with Louisa, and she went into the ladies’ room, opening the door and calling to make sure the room was empty. It was. Then Louisa went back to the counter, and I put my sign on the outer door, then went in and started to clean, the sinks and whatnot. Well, when I do a job, I do it carefully. So it wasn’t long before I saw, hanging on a hook inside the last toilet stall on the other side of the faucets, a handbag. Actually, it looked like a tapestry bag, rather large, with colorful designs. I took a peek inside the bag. It was full of money! I didn’t want to count it then and there. I was on the verge of coming out, when I remembered -- there had been an old lady earlier, who had trouble getting around. She had a walker. I remembered seeing her with that tapestry bag. Her bag was hung up on the back of her booth. Then it hit me -- it had still been there when she left! I didn’t think anything of it at the time. For one thing, lost and found is not my concern. The waitresses usually take care of that sort of problem, taking possession of anything that has been lost by mistake. And I’m too busy with my own chores to bother looking for new ones. But this was odd. Then I thought of something else. I hadn’t remembered the old lady going to the ladies’ room. Come to think of it, she couldn’t have gone, even if she wanted to. There are steps that a handicapped person couldn’t climb. I always thought this would get Tom Greene in big trouble, since there are public access laws in this state, but it hadn’t yet. Maybe we were too small and insignificant to bother with. Or maybe the people who do the enforcing hadn’t had the pleasure of real world eating at the Palace Diner! Anyway, this was an emergency, so I did what Tom always told his new employees to do (but never expected that anyone would really ever do): I got out my cell phone and called him at home. I was in luck. He wasn’t asleep yet. He took it all in, thought a minute, and then asked me to count the money. I did -- it was more than one thousand dollars! There were also some family pictures in the bag, one of them of the old lady herself. And, of course, there was a name and an address. She would have no trouble getting her property back. Tom was pleased. He told me to take possession of the bag, and that he’d be back at the diner inside an hour. I wrapped the tapestry bag up in some large vacuum cleaner bags that were on my cleaning cart. I unlocked my locker, got out a history book, put the tapestry bag into my locker, and went to a back table with my history book. I planned to get in some reading for class before Tom returned. When I looked around, there was Louisa at the counter, with a clear view of both rest rooms. She was doing some inventory work for the day shift, orders to be made for butter, hamburger, rolls and cheese, probably. We sell a lot of cheeseburgers during the night shift, and Tom monitors all supplies carefully. John came back to say good night, and with a yawn, said he was heading back up the hill, to his dormitory. I thanked him again for his help with the assignment. He said it was nothing, and also mentioned that we served the worst cup of coffee he’d ever had! Mary Ingram finished her third cup of coffee, then went back to the ladies’ room. Had I remembered? Yes, I had taken the “No Admission” sign off the door. Wearing fresh makeup, Mary came out a few minutes later, said a cheery good night to Louisa and me, and left the diner. “See you again tonight,” she waved. She was always there. We were, she pointed out, her family, after all. That left Sarah Upton, and I felt almost sorry for her. She clearly didn’t want to leave, and seemed to have no place to go. She seemed to postpone leaving as long as she could. After Mary left she went up to the counter, but Louisa’s foul mood discouraged conversation. Sarah Upton tried to pull herself and her remaining dignity together, and with a shrug of the shoulders, waved a goodbye to me, and left the diner. At that point, Tom Greene entered. He quickly came over to me. I nodded, to assure him that I had the tapestry bag, safe and sound. “But I can do better than that, Tom. I know who the thief was, too!”","['John Beddington', 'Louisa Perry', 'Mary Ingram', 'Sarah Upton']",Louisa Perry,Sarah Upton,"Analysis:
The core of the mystery lies in the discovery of the tapestry bag containing stolen money. The fact that it was found in the last toilet stall, a location rarely accessed, and that it was clearly a valuable item, points directly to Sarah Upton as the primary thief. Her prolonged presence near the ladies’ room, coupled with her seemingly deliberate avoidance of the “No Admission” sign, and her departure shortly after Tom Greene’s return, creates a strong circumstantial link. The fact that she was the last person to be seen in the diner, and that she seemed to be attempting to maintain a facade of composure, further solidifies her involvement. The fact that she was also the only person who didn’t immediately mention the old lady and the missing bag suggests a calculated deception.

Reasoning:
*   **Sarah Upton:** Her prolonged presence in the ladies’ room, her avoidance of the “No Admission” sign, and her subsequent departure after Tom Greene's return are all highly suggestive of her involvement. Her seemingly forced composure and avoidance of direct conversation with Louisa further suggest she was attempting to conceal her actions. The fact she was the last person to be seen in the diner, combined with her seemingly unconcerned demeanor, creates a compelling narrative. The bag itself is a key piece of evidence – its size and the presence of family pictures suggest a deliberate attempt to conceal her actions.

"“Surprise!” Paula was startled as she walked through the door. Amidst the colorful balloons and fluttering streamers, she was, in fact, surprised. Her cheeks had already been flushed by the hot July weather. Now, her skin color was nearing tomato-red. Again the crowd shouted, “Surprise! Happy birthday!” Paula smiled. She was gleaming at her co-workers. “Thanks everyone!” she exclaimed. “It’s so nice that you guys thought of me.” “No sweat,” replied Paula’s boss, Mr. Bento. “You’re a hardworking girl who deserves to have a wonderful birthday. Except, I hope you don’t mind that there’s no cake. You know that I’m on a strict diet!” He winked at her and blew his party kazoo. “Yeah, you’ve definitely earned it,” added Luis. His warm smile caught Paula’s eyes. Paula blushed. She had always had a crush on Luis. His thick black hair formed a beautiful beacon to his sparkling blue eyes. His chin was cut to perfection and his pale white cheeks reminded her of royalty. “Gee, thanks ... I don’t know what to say,” Paula managed to stammer. “Stop wasting time already! We can’t party all day and you know it,” interrupted Julianna. Her lips curled into a sneer, “There’s work to be done, after all. So I suggest that we let her open the gifts.” The remark was cutting. Paula looked down and frowned. It seemed that Julianna’s only goal was to make sure that work was done fervently and in a timely fashion. Though she herself was small (under four feet tall), Julianna’s attitude was not. “We’ll get to work eventually,” Mr. Bento announced. He had a smirk on his round face. “But first, let’s party!” Paula shrugged and giggled as she began to unwrap her presents. She opened up a new watch, some candles, a set of dishes and an old spatula. “That spatula is going be worth hundreds of dollars as an antique some day,” said a feeble, yet excited voice. Paula turned and grinned at Geraldine. The white-haired woman smiled at Paula, revealing her pearly white teeth. “Here’s my present,” said Luis, as he placed it into Paula’s hands. “Wow! Look at the size of that cupcake. I love it! Thanks so much!” Paula gave Luis a hug, “I can’t wait to sit down and eat it.” “That’ll have to be at lunchtime,” said Mr. Bento, as he blew the party kazoo one last time. “We really do have to get a move on today’s work.” “He’s right,” said Julianna, as Mr. Bento left the room. “Looks like you’re going to have to be a responsible adult and work hard for a change.” Paula sighed. Her other co-workers helped her pick up the room. Then, Paula placed the cupcake in a paper sack, and stood on her toes in order to reach the top shelf. She put the bag up on the shelf as far back as she could reach and left the room. When noon finally arrive, Paula jumped up from her computer. Missing breakfast made working through the first shift very difficult. As a result of her hunger pangs, she briskly walked to the office kitchen with her mind set on devouring the birthday cupcake. Paula stopped. She looked down to see nothing but a few moist chocolate crumbs sitting peacefully on the table. She sighed out of frustration. Mr. Bento walked in, “Holy smokes kiddo. What seems to be the matter?” “My cupcake is gone,” cried Paula. “I’m so disappointed. Do you realize just how long I have been waiting to eat it?” “Oh, that’s too bad,” he replied. “Consider yourself lucky, that cupcake was probably over 300 calories!” Paula looked at Mr. Bento’s round belly. Her eyes seemed to accuse him of stuffing himself full of her birthday treat. Mr. Bento noticed this, “Of course I didn’t take it,” he replied. Paula thought for a moment. Then, her face grew angry. She ran to the back of the office where Julianna and Geraldine worked. Julianna didn’t even look up from her typing when Paula entered, but instead rolled her eyes. This caused Paula’s voice to erupt, “Why did you eat my cupcake?” Julianna snapped back, “I didn’t take your cupcake. I haven’t even looked up from my computer all morning. There’s work to be done and I’m much too busy completing it.” As the two rivals glared at each other, Geraldine walked into the room sipping from her coffee mug. “What’s wrong,” she asked. “Oh nothing,” replied Julianna. “Paula is just accusing me of stealing her cupcake, when she knows full well that I am way too busy with work to commit such a silly crime.” “You did too steal it,” Paula shot back. “Well, I didn’t do it either,” offered Geraldine. “I forgot my teeth this morning and wouldn’t be able to chew it! She smiled at Paula to reveal her toothless gums. Geraldine then thought for a moment. “You put it in a paper bag, didn’t you?” “Yes.” “Then, I know who took it. Follow me, honey.” Geraldine led Paula and Julianna down the hall and into Luis’s cubicle. She pointed at the wastebasket. Inside next to a few old newspapers and some used scotch tape was the brown paper bag. Paula gasped. Julianna let out a satisfied sigh. Luis, flushed and saturated in sweat, entered the room. “You thief!” cried Julianna. “How dare you eat Paula’s cupcake!” Luis looked perplexed. He quickly got defensive. “How could I have? I haven’t been here all morning. I just got back from running errands. Besides, why would I steal the present that I got for her?” Paula looked saddened and confused. All of her co-workers had an alibi, and she didn’t know who had wronged her. (… Or did she?)","['Geraldine', 'Julianna', 'Luis', 'Mr. Bento']",Geraldine,Julianna,"Analysis:
The core of the mystery lies in Paula’s sudden and dramatic reaction to the cupcake, coupled with Geraldine’s seemingly innocent observation of the paper bag. Paula’s intense agitation and accusations, combined with the evidence of the cupcake being hidden in a wastebasket, strongly suggest guilt. Her frantic behavior and insistence on proving her innocence are indicative of a desire to deflect suspicion and a possible attempt to manipulate the situation. Julianna’s denial and subsequent deflection, coupled with Geraldine’s observation and the discovery of the cupcake, further solidify her as the primary culprit.

Reasoning: Geraldine’s seemingly innocuous observation of the bag – a detail that directly links the cupcake to her own actions – is a crucial piece of evidence. Her nonchalant demeanor and the subsequent explanation of forgetting her teeth, combined with her knowing smile, create a plausible scenario of her taking the cupcake. Julianna’s elaborate denial, while perhaps a calculated attempt to appear innocent, doesn’t fully account for the sudden outburst and the meticulousness of the cupcake’s concealment. Luis’s defensive response and lack of a verifiable alibi are also significant. The fact that Paula’s co-workers corroborate her story and the presence of the cupcake in the wastebasket points to a deliberate act of theft, rather than a simple oversight.

"Families can be strange. Grandpa hated the sunshine, and waited eagerly for dusk. “It's too hot,” he complained bitterly. And then he told them about the treasure. “When I was 5 years old, my grandfather told me a secret,” he said, “and then insisted I make him a promise. ‘If you live past 80 years old, you can tell it to your grandchildren,’ he'd said.” Grandpa fanned himself with a magazine. “This secret has traveled 150 years. It's the story of Dead Man's Island.” Poison was rumored, or perhaps natural causes. No one knew exactly how that famous dead man came to be dead, or even who he the dead man was exactly. “It was a tiny, 120-foot island,” Grandpa said, “and with everyone knowing he'd been buried there, it was the only name they could think of!” Grandpa studied everyone carefully, like he was hoping they could unravel the mystery. “What became California belonged to Spain then,” he told his two grandchildren, “and later to Mexico, though not until 1821.” Grandpa glared at the sun. “Lonely souls came here on ships and traded barrels of food for cowhides from the local Mexican ranchers, which they sold for huge profits when they returned to the East Coast. Enormous herds of cattle roamed the flat lands. It wasn't until later that the city became Los Angeles.” But 150 years ago, a trading ship's sailor shared a secret with Grandpa's grandfather. The captain of the S.S. Charleston had buried a valuable treasure exactly 17 miles due north from the center of Dead Man's Island ― and then 17 paces east. “That night they had to set sail around South America and back to Boston; but it was a stormy night, and their ship was lost at sea. When my grandfather heard the news, he realized he was the only person alive who knew where their treasure was buried.” “Are you making this up?” Bobby challenged. “Why didn't you look for the treasure yourself?” “Because the island disappeared. I though my grandfather might've made it up, and he never gave me a good explanation. But he did tell me the island had disappeared in 1928. And he swore the treasure was nearby, less than 300 miles.” “Maybe it's in Los Angeles,” volunteered Ann, Bobby's sister. “Could be,” Grandpa replied confidently. “Up until about 80 years ago, there were maybe 900,000 people here. Nowhere near the 12 million people that are here today. Then irrigation came, and highways, and big airplane manufacturers. It'd be funny if underneath it all was a forgotten sea captain's buried treasure.” Ann wanted to find the treasure, but only to please Grandpa. Bobby was thinking of everything he could buy with a stake in a 150-year-old treasure. Soon they were asking the local librarian for her newest atlas of maps, and then studying California's coast. There were several islands near San Francisco's coast, and even one that they called Treasure Island. But San Francisco was 400 miles north, and Grandpa's grandfather had insisted that Dead Man's Island was within 300 miles. 25 miles south of San Pedro, California, they found Santa Catalina Island ― but it was over 20 miles long (and 22 miles from the coast)! They wondered if Lisa, the librarian, had given them a defective atlas. Lisa was a young college student, and she seemed eager to help them find any island within 300 miles; especially since Ann told her that if they could find Dead Man's Island, there was treasure just 17 miles north of it ― and then 17 paces east! “I've spent five years at college studying the history of California,” Lisa announced, seeming anxious to prove how knowledgeable and helpful she could be. She pulled down several books about Sacramento. But, still, they never found Dead Man's Island. When they returned to Grandpa's house, a mysterious stranger was talking to him. Grandpa did most of the talking, and the stranger looked like he'd rather keep quiet. “This is my friend Mike, and he gives boat tours to tourists,” Grandpa explained. “He's been sailing our coast for the last 15 years. So I asked him if he'd ever heard of Dead Man's Island.” Mike stared back, silently. “And he said yes!” Grandpa said. “He has a newspaper article that proves it.” They looked hopefully at Mike, who stood still and unsmiling, before walking toward his jeep. Mike returned silently with a book about the history of Los Angeles. He opened the book in front of everyone, turning to a page about the community of San Pedro. Silently, he pointed to a picture on page 128, which displayed a lonely fence traveling down a steep hill; and in the background was the ocean. No more than 120 feet long, close to the shore, was a rocky island. “Dead Man's Island, 1873,” read the picture's caption. Even though it was an hour's away, Ann insisted they go there right away. “It's gone,” Mike muttered. They dredged the harbor in 1928. They wanted to make it easier for ships to enter the port, and they dug away the entire island!” They consulted a map and identified the right location, which was just 17 miles north. “Now let's get going,” shouted Grandpa, “before this afternoon gets any hotter!” They bought four shovels, and Grandpa drove them north, following the driving instructions he'd printed out from the internet. Soon they'd found the location: a big field in back of an abandoned factory. Its high windows were dark, and it was apparent that no one worked there any more. They hoped no one would see them digging. “I'll go scope out the geography,” Mike said quickly, “while the three of you park the car.” He hopped out before anyone said anything, and Grandpa looked for a hidden parking spot. Bobby stared after Mike, wondering if he was going to steal their treasure. As soon as the car stopped, they ran to the field. It was nothing but a giant patch of dirt, at least an acre-wide, and they saw Mike bending over a deep hole towards the center. “Someone's been digging!” Mike shouted. Grandpa arrived last, carrying the four shovels, and became furious when he came upon the emptiness of the hole. “Did they beat us to the treasure?” Ann asked. Grandpa studied the hole intently. But then he began laughing and dancing. “This hole isn't deep enough!” he said. “My grandfather said the treasure was buried six feet down, and this hole is only four feet deep. The treasure's still down there, waiting for us!” Everyone stared thoughtfully for a moment before they grabbed shovels and started digging. The kids dug with an unearthed adrenaline for the rest of the afternoon. Grandpa’s arthritis made it nearly impossible for him to break the surface of the hardened dirt, but his excitement matched the others, and maybe even exceeded it. He continued to cheer and chant until Bobby struck something. It was a pouch with the faded letters, “S.S. Charleston,” branded into the leather. Below the pouch were several layers of something brittle and crumbly, like buried rubber. Grandpa, Mike, and Ann found more in every direction ― for several feet. But there was nothing else but dirt. Had someone gotten here before them and stolen the treasure? As the sun set on the four treasure hunters, Bobby suddenly announced that, not only did he know where the treasure was, he knew who'd been lying.","['Grandpa', ""Grandpa's grandfather"", 'Lisa', 'Mike']",Lisa,Grandpa,"Analysis:
The story presents a compelling case against Grandpa, driven by his obsessive belief in the treasure’s existence and his insistence on the island’s disappearance. His detailed recollection of the history, the cryptic clues he provided, and his unwavering conviction, coupled with his apparent disregard for the others’ efforts, strongly suggests guilt. The repeated emphasis on the island’s disappearance, coupled with his insistence on the treasure’s location, points to a deeply rooted delusion. The discovery of the pouch and the subsequent digging, culminating in the uncovering of the treasure, directly links him to the crime.

Reasoning: Grandpa’s obsession with the island and his unwavering belief in its treasure, especially his insistence on the 1873 location, is the primary motive. He meticulously constructed a narrative around the treasure, prioritizing his belief over the concerns of his grandchildren. His refusal to acknowledge the possibility of a mistake or the lack of concrete evidence further strengthens the suspicion of guilt. The fact that he insisted on the location, even after repeated attempts to find it, demonstrates a fixation that bordered on obsession. The seemingly random digging and the discovery of the pouch, confirming the treasure's presence, directly contradicts his initial claim of the island being lost. Furthermore, his demeanor throughout the story – a manic excitement and a defiant insistence on his own story – points to a delusional state.

"The Deer Valley Rock Art Center is a repository of art and history, preserving ancient petroglyphs and pictographs for the modern world to study and enjoy. Maintained as a part of Arizona State University, it is ideally situated near caches of desert rock, upon which natives could leave their mark in the clay-coated surfaces. The meaning of this art will forever be uncertain, as the artists died long before any art critics had the chance to ask. Since the artists are long gone, their work is priceless, valuable beyond any dollar measure. Sadly, such value can lead to problems as well. Dr. Welsh could barely contain himself. First, someone had delivered, practically to his doorstep, the most astounding piece of art ever, and now, not a week later, it had been stolen. It was intolerable. How could anyone stoop so low as to steal this prize of humanity, this “Stona Lisa” of petroglyphs? Only money could drive a person to act so fiendishly, he reasoned. Disgusted, he shook his head and waited. Sure enough, his four research students showed up for their Monday morning assignments, right on time. Three of them made it on time, anyway. Denise showed up five minutes late, her leg in a cast. Dr. Welsh was too preoccupied to notice, so she didn’t get the usual lecture on punctuality. Dr. Welsh knew that one of these four was the culprit. His other staff all had perfect alibis, and the evidence pointed clearly to an inside job. The alarm had been deactivated Sunday, at 11:03 a.m., and reactivated just three minutes later. The thief had known the codes and known exactly where to find their prize quickly – back in the preservation lab. So far, no one had informed the students of the theft. He decided to keep it that way, for the moment. Only the thief would know. Aside from the time of the theft, Dr. Welsh had only one other clue to work with. A trail of sand had fallen from the thief’s pants or shoes as he or she walked through the building. In Arizona, such a thing wouldn’t be unusual, but a quick lab test had shown that the sand didn’t match the local sand – it had a different composition, and came from somewhere else. The students had just had a three-day weekend, so the culprit had probably gotten sandy while on vacation somewhere. It was time to begin. Dr. Welsh took a deep breath to compose himself, and went to greet his students. “Welcome back everyone. I trust you all had a relaxing weekend.” Skye Smith piped up immediately. “It was good, but not as nice as being here.” Juan Carde snorted at her. “Are you kidding? Anything is more relaxing than work.” When Dr. Welsh raised an eyebrow, Juan hurried to adjust his wording. “But working here is still better than other places, I mean.” “Oh, would you two stop sucking up so we can get our assignments?” Denise wasn’t in the mood to be patient. “I want to go sit down already.” Denise was usually such a sweet girl that she caught Dr. Welsh’s attention. “My apologies Denise, I hadn’t noticed your leg before now.” He waved them all into the lobby, where chairs were plentiful. “There’s no rush to get to work on a Monday, but we can certainly talk sitting down.” Once they were seated, Dr. Welsh knew what he wanted to ask everyone, and had the perfect place to start. “However did you manage to break your leg this weekend?” Denise grimaced, either in pain or embarrassment; it was difficult to tell which. “I thought it would be a good idea to hit the slopes up in Aspen, Colorado. About the time I tumbled down the mountainside Saturday morning, I started to rethink that idea.” Dr. Welsh needed a little more information. “How did you manage to get home with that leg?” “After they had me patched up, they contacted my parents for me. They came and drove me home after I was released from the hospital Sunday afternoon. They said that next year I should just take them along so that they could enjoy the skiing part too. That’s sympathy for you.” Dr. Welsh nodded thoughtfully. “What about you Mr. Gaigon? You’ve been awfully quiet this morning.” Jim quickly looked up from the floor. (Had he been avoiding Dr. Welsh’s eyes, or sneaking a nap?) “I’m sorry professor; I didn’t – YAWN – sleep much last night. I spent the weekend in Roswell, New Mexico, visiting the International UFO Museum and Research Center. I came back late yesterday afternoon, but I tell you, that desert sun coming west was murder on my eyes. I kept dreaming about bright spots and aliens all night long. It was creepy.” Juan scoffed at his story. “UFO’s, ha! You think the sun was bad on your drive? Coming back from Long Beach, California yesterday afternoon was just as bright, and I hate driving into the sun. Oh, but a weekend in the surf was well worth it.” Dr. Welsh looked surprised. “Why Juan, I didn’t know you were a surfer.” Now it was Juan’s turn to look a bit embarrassed. “Well, I’m not much of one yet, I’m still learning. When I say I spent my time in the surf, I mean exactly that. I kept falling off my board. I think the people were calling me ‘Can’t-Stay-On Juan’ by the time I left.” That got a chuckle out of Dr. Welsh, despite his usually professional demeanor, and despite all that was on his mind. “We’ll promise to let you be just plain Juan here, never fear. What about you Skye, how was your vacation? You look a bit tanned.” “And well I should,” answered Skye, flipping back her long brown hair. I flew down to Cozumel, Mexico for some scuba diving with the fishes. I’ll bet you didn’t know that I scuba either.” “Well actually...” began Dr. Welsh, but Skye went on after inhaling. “It was beautiful, just like always, with the sparkling water and the beautiful fish, and so much to see, and the perfect sun for tanning. Oh, I could have stayed forever, except that I would never do that to you. Even so, I almost didn’t make it back. My plane was delayed, and delayed again, and it didn’t get back here until one this morning. But I’m still not as sleepy as Jim. I slept on the plane. I always say – get your sleep when there’s nothing to do, or else you’ll miss it when there is.” She glared over at her snoozing colleague. “Okay Jim, you can wake up now, I’m done.” Jim yawned and stretched. “I feel much better now,” he managed. “That’s good Jim,” began Dr. Welsh, “because I have some important news for you all.” They all perked up, attentive to what he would say. “Yesterday morning, someone stole the ‘Stona Lisa’ we received last week.” Four gasps caused him to pause. “Worse, the theft was by one of our own – one of you four, and I’m afraid that I now know who that person is. You all have alibis, but the guilty person is lying. Please don’t do anything silly, a police officer is patiently waiting in the next room.”","['Denise Hurst', 'Jim Gaigon', 'Juan Carde', 'Skye Smith']",Juan Carde,Skye Smith,"Analysis:
The core of the mystery lies in the conflicting alibis and the discovery of the sand – a crucial piece of evidence that points to a deliberate attempt to obscure the thief’s movements. The fact that the thief knew the codes and the location of the prize suggests a level of planning and familiarity with the museum’s security systems. The fact that the thief had a vacation planned, coupled with the fabricated story about a scuba diving trip, is highly suspicious. Skye’s story of falling off her board and a delayed plane adds another layer of complexity, suggesting a rushed and potentially desperate attempt to escape. Jim’s sleepiness and the delayed plane further complicate the investigation, creating a plausible but unsettling narrative. Denise’s seemingly innocuous comment about needing a break, combined with her body language, is a deliberate attempt to deflect suspicion.

Reasoning:
*   **Denise Hurst:** Her seemingly innocent comment about needing a break is a classic deflection tactic, especially given the timing of the theft. Her lack of alertness and her discomfort with the situation strongly indicate she’s hiding something. The fact that she was initially so dismissive of Dr. Welsh’s concerns is also noteworthy.

*   **Jim Gaigon:** His story of a delayed plane and sleepiness raises immediate red flags. While he claims to have been asleep, the timing and the fact that he was avoiding eye contact suggest he’s attempting to conceal something. The fabricated story of scuba diving is a flimsy attempt to distract from the core issue.

*   **Juan Carde:** His story of a surfing trip and the detail about falling off his board provides a tangible, albeit bizarre, explanation for his presence at the museum. His nervousness and the admission of sleepiness further strengthen his guilt. The detail about the bright spots and aliens, while potentially theatrical, is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

*   **Skye Smith:** Her story of a vacation and the description of her scuba diving experience, combined with her casual demeanor, is suspicious. The fact that she was enjoying the vacation, coupled with the fabricated story, makes her a prime suspect. Her almost nonchalant reaction to Dr. Welsh’s questions adds to the impression of deception.

GUILTY: Skye Smith"
"“That is exactly the wrong course of action, sir. I know these waters and these currents. To try to row to safety in the lifeboat would be an exercise in futility – quite possibly, suicidal.” “Yeah, you know these waters and these currents so well. Then what are we doing marooned on this desert island, Captain?” Kildare took a swing at Jim Jensen. The younger man nimbly ducked, then pushed the Captain down into the sand. “You’re the one who got us into this mess, old man,” he sneered. “And I’m the man to get us out of it. Who’s with me?” Kevin Morton helped Captain Kildare to his feet, holding the ancient mariner back as he struggled to get at Jensen. “I’m with the Captain,” Marvin Fishback piped up, glancing anxiously out at the ocean – passive now, but subject to furious change at a moment’s notice. “We should just wait to be rescued. We’d all be drowned if we’re out on the open water in the lifeboat and another storm came up. Besides, I’m in no condition to row a boat,” he added because when he’d washed up on shore two days earlier, he’d badly scraped them on the rocks and they were now swollen and infected. “Yeah, sure,” Jensen growled. “But your hands are still plenty good enough to lift food from the provisions chest, huh?” Fishback jumped to his feet and pointed an angry finger at the accusing man. “I never took anything but my daily ration! It-it must’ve been an animal that got into the chest.” “Seen any animals on this barren postage stamp of an island?” Mark Colson smirked. “I’m with Jensen. We have to take some action before we all starve to death or die of dehydration sitting around on this speck in the ocean. I’ll pick up Fishback’s slack.” Jensen facetiously saluted the man. “That’s more like it.” He looked around at the others. Pointing at Mark Colson, he said, “now I’m sure we have to try and row out of here, before Mr. Champion Kayaker there gets it in his head to set out all on his own like he did during the storm, when he tried to hog the lone lifeboat for himself.” “That’s a dirty lie!” Colson shouted. Kevin Morton had to hold him back now from taking a swing at Jensen. “You aren’t going to convince anyone by bullying or berating them, Jensen,” Morton said. He turned to the sixth member of the stranded group. “What about you, Latrisha? Stay or go?” “I agree with the Captain,” the young woman stated. “He’s the only one qualified to decide on the matter.” Her eyes blazed at Jensen. “Unlike a certain someone who had the bright idea that a week-long cruise off the Baja Peninsula in a rickety old boat would somehow work wonders on a failed marriage.” “Here we go!” Jensen said, throwing up his arms. “The good doctor has made her diagnosis. All her patients can die, so long as she gets the last word.” Lanigan slapped Jensen across the face. Morton shook his head and rolled his eyes. These people he’d been shipwrecked with were certainly no cooperative Swiss Family Robinson or jovial crew of the S.S. Minnow. They had all been passengers on Captain Kildare’s old restored yacht, which had proved woefully incapable of handling the squall that blew up unexpectedly one hundred nautical miles or so off the Peninsula. The Mary Kildare had been tossed around like a cork in the suddenly raging seas and then been torn apart. Jensen, Lanigan, Colson, the Captain and Morton had scrambled aboard the lifeboat before the yacht had gone under, while Fishback had been washed overboard, to wash up later on the same small, rocky island with the tiny beach on which the lifeboat had run aground. Now, three days later, with half the food and water gone from the lifeboat’s provisions chest, their chances of survival were slimming as rapidly as their physiques. So, when the blistering sun had at last sunk into the sea, it was a surly group of people that bedded down under the flimsy tarp on the open beach. It came as only a mild surprise to Morton to find Jim Jensen missing the next morning. The morning after that they discovered his lifeless body in the surf. Latrisha Lanigan examined her estranged and now deceased husband and then pronounced without emotion, “He was beaten to death. Judging by the decomposition that has already taken place, I’d say he died the night before yesterday.” “He was clubbed with one of the lifeboat oars,” Captain Kildare stated, striding back down from the lifeboat. “There’s a small crack in one of them. There’re bloodstains on the bottom of the boat, meaning he was killed on shore and then rowed out to sea, his body thrown overboard to try to conceal the fact he was murdered. But the currents took him right back to the shore where he’d come from,” the man added, grimly shaking his head. “The killer should have weighed his body down with something,” Lanigan said dispassionately, “because when a body decomposes, gases are released, which will force it to rise to the surface of the water.” “So, someone tried to confine Jensen to the deep, huh?” Fishback said, glancing suspiciously around at the others. “Get him to sleep with the fishes.” “Or maybe the sharks,” Colson said, eyeing everyone with equal suspicion. “To try to cover up his crime.” Morton stared down at Jim Jensen’s body gently rocking back and forth in the surf. “Hey, maybe he actually tried to row away by himself!” Fishback suddenly exclaimed. “Then he accidentally conked himself with an oar and took a header overboard, and then washed up with the boat back on this godforsaken island for a second time. It’s possible!” “No, it’s not,” Morton said, looking over at the lifeboat. It was turned upside down on the beach to protect its interior. “That boat’s in exactly the same place it’s always been since we got here. That didn’t happen by accident. The killer must have carefully returned it, again trying to cover up his crime. We have to face the fact that one of us is a murderer.” “Well, I can’t say he didn’t deserve it,” Colson commented. “The guy sure was a sour apple.” Lanigan and the Captain nodded their agreement. “And it’s one less mouth to feed,” Fishback added. Morton looked from one haggard, sleep and food-deprived face to the other. Then he snapped his fingers, snapping the shipwreck victims out of their stupor. “I know who killed him,” Morton said, staring directly at the murderer.","['Captain Kildare', 'Latrisha Lanigan', 'Mark Colson', 'Marvin Fishback']",Mark Colson,Captain Kildare,"Analysis:
The evidence points strongly towards Captain Kildare as the primary perpetrator. The meticulous nature of the murder – the deliberate placement of the lifeboat, the bloodstains on the bottom, and the fact that the boat was turned upside down to conceal the body – indicates a calculated attempt to stage a murder. The seemingly random nature of the attack, combined with Kildare’s dismissive attitude towards Jensen’s struggles and his subsequent claim of a “small crack” in the oars, suggests a deliberate attempt to mislead investigators. The motive is unclear – perhaps a longstanding rivalry, a past grievance, or a desperate attempt to appear heroic – but the meticulous planning and concealment of the crime are key.

Reasoning: Kildare’s callousness and his insistence on a “small crack” as the cause of death directly contradict the possibility of a spontaneous accident. The deliberate staging of the scene points to a premeditated act, not a result of a tragic accident. The Captain’s subsequent denial of responsibility further strengthens the case. Furthermore, the fact that the boat was turned upside down is a significant indicator of deliberate concealment.
